			<p><em>(Note:&#160; this article is pretty dated, and used IntelliJ 8.&#160; I plan a follow-up covering IntelliJ 9)</em></p>  <p>So I have this semi-fancy Google <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/device.html">Android Dev Phone 1</a>.&#160; Lately I've been devoting part of my spare time to learning about programming for <a href="http://www.android.com/">Android</a> (the OS of the phone).&#160; Google (probably because they didn't ask for my opinion and/or input) decided to use Java as the lingua franca for Android programming.&#160; If you ask me - and I know you will - they should have used C# and Mono (I might be a bit biased here).&#160; Luckily, years ago I had done Java programming, so I wasn't that intimidated by the use of Java on Android.</p>  <p>The first big question that every developer faces is which IDE?&#160; There are a few Java IDE's out there, but if you ask me the only ones worth considering are <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> and <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea">IntelliJ</a>.&#160; The documentation for Android points you to using Eclipse.&#160; Eclipse is a good IDE.&#160; However, back in the day when I was getting paid for Java development, my employer got us all copies of <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ</a>, from JetBrains.&#160; I liked it.&#160; I like it enough that if I landed a contract tomorrow that involved Java, I'd buy me a copy of IntelliJ. </p>  <p>So, all that being said, I figured I'd give IntelliJ a spin as I travelled down the stack-trace of Android programming.&#160; Here are my observations, in general:</p>  <ol>   <li>There is an Android plug-in for IntelliJ.&#160; Now, you might believe that development on the Android plug is dead.&#160; Not true.&#160; The plug-in is undergoing active development - it just seems to be kind of slow </li>    <li>I found the installation of the Android plug-in for IntelliJ far easier than for Eclipse.&#160; Just download the most current release, and then unzip to your plugins folder in your IntelliJ installation.&#160; With Eclipse, <a href="http://www.opgenorth.net/getting-started-coding-for-my-android-dev-phone-1.aspx">it is simple</a>, but not when the documentation is wrong. </li>    <li>The IntelliJ plug-in is simple, and seems to get the job done.&#160; It's a bit to simple at this time, if you ask me.&#160; The <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/adt.html">ADT</a> for Eclipse provides a far richer dev-centric experience for Android coding.&#160; For example there are designers to help you with laying out your form, a lot more control over starting up the Android emulator, and better tooling for hooking up the debugger to either the emulator or an app running on the physical phone. </li>    <li>Being a Resharper junkie, I found that IntelliJ was more natural for me to use. </li>    <li>I didn't run into to many problems when I was trying to use/convert Eclipse project with IntelliJ. This is good, because the vast majority (all?) projects I've seen are all Eclipse based. </li> </ol>  <p>So, my conclusion at the end of the day, is that I'm going to stick with Eclipse for my Android development.&#160; There just seems to be less friction at the moment if you're using Eclipse.&#160; In a couple of months maybe I revisit IntelliJ and see what's new with it and Android development.&#160; However, at this time, I'd like to really concentrate on learning the Android SDK, and it seems simplest to me right now with Eclipse.</p>
