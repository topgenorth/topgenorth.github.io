			<p>Over the Easter long weekend, I experience my own resurrection of sorts.&#160; On Thursday just before Easter I noticed that my NAS, a Thecus N3200 Pro with three Seagate Barracuda 7200.11 drives in a RAID5 array, was beeping and displaying a “RAID degraded” message.&#160; I didn’t worry about it to much, as it was late on Thursday, and I figured I was safe/okay with three drives in a RAID5 array.</p>  <p>So, the next morning I check things out.&#160; Turns out all was not well in Whoville.&#160; While check the RAID config, I saw that two of the three drives had “warnings” associated with them.&#160; This was Not Good.&#160; Two out of three failing HDD in a RAID5 array is A Bad Thing.&#160; A bit of Googling and conversing with the <a href="http://www.harddata.com">vendor who sold me the NAS</a> (note- I’ve got no problems with them, Hard Data has always been great for me for the past six or seven years) and it seems that there is a <a href="http://seagate.custkb.com/seagate/crm/selfservice/search.jsp?DocId=207951&amp;Hilite=">firmware upgrade</a> for my particular trio of NAS drives.&#160; Luckily, I managed to get all my critical stuff off the NAS, so I’m not to worried about data loss.&#160; </p>  <p>So, I pull the drives, apply the firmware update, and try to rebuild. The NAS will not let me create a RAID5 array.&#160; So, I pull the drives one by one, and then proceed to check them out in a computer.&#160; Turns out that the two drives that had the warnings were okay, but the third drive, that was “warning-less” is toast.&#160; What is wrong with it I’m not sure, but the BIOS on the computer won’t recognize the drive after boot up.&#160; Had to RMA the drive back to Seagate.&#160; </p>  <p>So, now I sit, alone in my room, without my NAS.</p>
