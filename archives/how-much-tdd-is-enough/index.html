			<p>At the last <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/eamug">Edmonton Agile Methods User Group</a> meeting, we had a brief discussion around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage">code coverage</a>, and what should be an acceptable number to shoot for.&#160; Is it okay when the unit tests cover 80% of the code?&#160; Or should 100% be the only acceptable value?&#160; After all, how can you be confident in your code knowing that 20% of it isn't tested.</p>  <p>Allow me to go out on a limb here, and state with absolute certainty that the correct answer is &quot;It depends on your situation&quot;.&#160; Allow me to elaborate.</p>  <ol>   <li>The number sends a wrong message.&#160; If your team decides that they need some arbitrarily value to shoot for, that is what they will concentrate on.&#160; Developers will worry more about how many tests they need to write, rather than on the quality of their code. </li>    <li>Unit tests can suffer from the law of diminishing returns.&#160; To achieve that mythical number of 100% coverage would require a large amount of effort.&#160; I argue that in many cases, the high effort required drains away from the teams ability to keep delivering value in their software.&#160; In particular, exception testing comes to mind.&#160; You can spend a lot of time writing tests to cover parts of your code that, in theory, should never be executed. </li>    <li>Unit tests do not replace other forms of testing, so functionally speaking, you should still be covered.&#160; Sure, you may have some code that isn't covered with a unit test, but hopefully your crack team of functional testers will exercise that code as part of their efforts.&#160; If your functional testers find a problem, and you don't have a unit test that covers the code in question, then you will obviously write a test and fix the problem.&#160; If your functional testers don't find a problem, then you don't worry about it.&#160; <ul>       <li>Remember that as a part of agile, you have short iterations with working software at the end of each iteration.&#160; So, if there is some problem code that is not tested, your users will find out about it fairly quickly.&#160; The power of rapid feedback at work. </li>     </ul>   </li>    <li>The test part of TDD is a useful side-effect. The true value of TDD is that it helps you craft out a better design for your code.&#160; If you ask me, TDD should stand for Test Driven Design, not Test Driven Development (I do believe credit for this observation belongs to <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/">Roy Osherove</a> - at least that is where I heard from first). </li> </ol>
