			<p>A while ago, I posted a blog article about <a href="http://www.opgenorth.net/2009/06/19/using-intellij-for-android-development-2/">using IntelliJ for Android development</a>.&#160; Given that was a year ago, and one version of IntelliJ later, I thought I would do a follow up post.&#160; Long story short (and to sound like a TV commercial):&#160; I liked IntelliJ IDEA 9 so much, I bought a license.</p>  <p>Since I blogged last year, the Android plug-in for IntelliJ has really matured.&#160; I guess the only draw back to it is that you only get the Android plug-in when you buy the Unlimited Edition of IntelliJ – it’s not in the Community Edition.&#160; Here are some general comments/thoughts/observations of mine:</p>  <ul>   <li>It’s cool to have IntelliSense in the XML files.&#160; One of the biggest failings of Android (perhaps Java in general?) is the painful lack of a surface designer for a user interface.&#160; <a href="http://www.droiddraw.org/">DroidDraw</a> is tolerable with enough <a href="http://www.malts.com/index.php/Gateway-en">scotch</a>.&#160; One could say say the same thing about the UI “designer” that comes with the <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/eclipse-adt.html">ADT</a>.&#160; So, much of the time I find myself just plugging away at the UI in XML.&#160; Sub-optimal, but I don’t have the resources to write a nice designer for the Android layout files, so I’ll just pour another double of Talisker and carry on.&#160; :)</li>    <li>I like the fact that, as a Resharper junkie, IntelliJ seems very natural to me to use.&#160; The keyboard mappings are not 100% between IntelliJ and Resharper, but that is merely semantics. I find that within about 30 minutes or so I’ve recovered from the differences and that I don’t suffer to much of a penalty switching between the two.</li>    <li>I’m a bit more structured when it comes to deplopyment.&#160; I don’t like how IntelliJ wraps all the deployment magic for me.&#160; Don’t get me wrong – it’s handy as all hell for development and getting an APK on my phone real quick.&#160; For production level stuff though, I’m finding that Rake more than handles what I need done.</li> </ul>  <p>Of course, with <a href="http://www.monodroid.net/">Monodroid</a> now in a closed beta and looming in the future, perhaps IntelliJ will be redundant to me?&#160; Can I actually just write my Android applications in C# and forget about Java? As <a href="http://www.monodroid.net/">Monodroid</a> is in a closed beta, I can’t really comment much about it at this point in time.&#160; I think I can say, without the <a href="www.go-mono.com">Mono</a> gods smiting me from above with hail, thunder, and lightening, that I’m cautiously optimistic that Monodroid will be appealing to those who want to target mobile devices.</p>  <p>So, over-all impression:&#160; </p>  <ul>   <li>I like IntelliJ better than Eclipse for Android development. </li>    <li>I’d say that IntelliJ is worth the money I spent on the unlimited license.&#160; </li> </ul>  <p><em>This claim may not be valid in all states.&#160; It is also void where prohibited by law.&#160; There is a good chance that it may not apply in Quebec.&#160; This definitely does not include batteries.&#160; YMMV.</em></p>
