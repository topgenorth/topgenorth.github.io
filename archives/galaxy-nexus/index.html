			<p>I recently got a Galaxy Nexus, and like a typical geek I <a href="http://androidforums.com/international-galaxy-nexus-all-things-root/452146-how-root-gsm-hspa-samsung-galaxy-nexus.html">unlocked the bootloader and then rooted it</a>. Life was good running Android 4.0.1. Well sort of. I had problems tethering my MacBook Pro via the WiFi hotspot, but no problems using Bluetooth. So nothing I couldn&rsquo;t work around.</p>
<p>Then I received an OTA update to Android 4.0.4 recently.  And this was when things started going not so good - specifically, for some blasted reason, I kept losing connectivity to Wind Mobile&rsquo;s network. At first I thought it was Wind Mobile having issues. This would be odd, because for me, Wind Mobile has been pretty solid. To troubleshoot I pulled my SIM card and dropped it into my Nexus One. Everything worked fine. So apparently something with my phone.</p>
<p>None of the simple tricks worked:</p>
<ul>
<li>pull the battery for 45 seconds</li>
<li>verify the APN settings</li>
<li>pull and re insert the SIM card.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;d had good luck with <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com">CyanogenMod</a> in the past, so I figured that maybe by installing that my problems would go away. No such luck.</p>
<p>After a bit of searching, the nearest thing I could figure out is that the radio firmware I received with Android 4.0.4 (XXLA2) was troublesome - it seems that there are reports of people having issues with it going back to March or so. One suggestion that I followed through on was flashing a new firmware for the radios.</p>
<p>To make a long story short I went over to the <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1405345">Galaxy Nexus I9250 Baseband dumps collection</a> page at <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/index.php">XDA-developers</a>, and update my radio to UGKL1. Now things to work just fine. If I understand things correctly, this radio has better support for the 850/1900/AWS frequencies that Wind Mobile uses.</p>
<p>Hopefully in the near future I&rsquo;ll remember to do another blog post on what I did. The information is out there, but it is a bit scattered.</p>
