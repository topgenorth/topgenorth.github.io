Edwards.&#160; The 101st developed slowly, as most in the Edmonton area were attracted to the 19th Alberta Dragoons, a cavalry regiment which had been established in January of 1908. </p>  <p>When war broke out in 1914, there was some question about the legality of using the existing militia regiments to fight overseas in Europe.&#160; As such, the newly formed Canadian Expeditionary Force was comprised entirely of new battalions and the 101st was not allowed to go overseas.&#160; The 101st Edmonton Fusilier recruited and contributed 1,200 men to these new battalions of the 1st Canadian Division, C.E.F in 1914.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.opgenorth.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/ler_revised_2.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; margin-left: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="ler_revised_2" border="0" alt="ler_revised_2" align="left" src="http://www.opgenorth.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/ler_revised_2_thumb.jpg" width="119" height="140" /></a> The 101st Edmonton Fusiliers are not longer around in any official capacity.&#160; The legacy of the of the 101st Fusiliers is perpetuated today by the Loyal Edmonton Regiment. </p>  <p>The Loyal Edmonton Regiment was formed up in 1915 as the 49th Battalion, C.E.F. to fight overseas.&#160; Many of the men that were originally recruited by the 101st Edmonton Fusiliers ended up serving in the 49th Battalion.&#160; As such, it was decided at the end of the First World War that the 49th Battalion, The Edmonton Regiment would perpetuate the 101st Edmonton Fusiliers.</p>  <p>In 1943, His Majesty King George VI decreed by royal charter that the Edmonton Regiment would be know as The Loyal Edmonton Regiment.</p>  <p>If you do live in Edmonton, you might want to check out the <a href="http://www.lermuseum.org/">Loyal Edmonton Regiment Museum</a> at the <a href="http://www.rewedmonton.ca/content_view2?CONTENT_ID=1268">Prince of Wales Armoury</a> one day.&#160; Lots of interesting history there, if you ask me.</p>
