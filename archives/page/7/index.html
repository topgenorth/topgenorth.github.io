		Wordy title.  To wordy.  Kind of like build files these days.

I remember when I first discovered Ant, and then <a href="http://nant.sourceforge.net">Nant</a>* .  I was pretty happy, as it allow a decent way to compile my Java (and C#) without using make files.  Life was good as I could finally introduce some structure into HOW code was compiled.  The build process was no longer using whatever "build" command the IDE exposed, hoping that I didn't forget a compiler directive or a file or a reference to some other library along the way.  Other programmers could also compile the code with out fear as well.  Having a tool like Nant is pretty crucial to the whole concept of continuous integration.

Somewhere along the way, though, Nant lost it's shine.  It isn't to hard to find these monster Nant scripts with all kinds of crazy things happening inside them.  Trying to work with these files can be a bit of a burden, to say the least.

This takes me back to the title:  it seems to me that build tools like Nant have kind of peaked, functionally speaking.  What does that mean?  We can always add more tasks (created in a real programming language) to do things for us, but in a lot of ways Nant is constrained by the fact that it is just XML.  We can always add tasks to Nant, but somethings just can't be handled by out of the box, one size fits all tasks from Nant (or <a href="http://nantcontrib.sourceforge.net">NantContrib</a>).  As soon as you run into those things, you need to start writing code.  XML is good for config files (to a point).  It's bad for programming logic.  It is not at all uncommon to see in build files if statements doing all kinds of things.  We don't need to (and should not) make XML into another programming language. 

I spent a bit of time tonight playing with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/boo-build-system/">Bake</a>.  For those who don't know, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/boo-build-system/">Bake</a> is to <a href="http://boo.codehaus.org">boo</a> what <a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org">Rake</a> is to <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">ruby</a>.  Or, in other terms, think of a build system that is actually based on a programming language, and not a configuration file.  Why did I pick Bake?  Well, it's boo, and I want to learn boo.  Boo is .NET, so I can leverage what I already know.  Plus, I'm reading <a href="http://www.ayende.com">Ayende'</a>s book <a href="http://www.manning.com/rahien/">Building Domain Specific Languages in Boo</a>, so Bake just seems to be a natural fit.

So far, I'm liking it.  In the span of a couple hours, I managed to figure out how to create a quick bake script (~ 40 lines of boo) to compile some code.  I'd say that this script more readable (or soluble, to use the words of Scott Bellware) when compared to a Nant script.  Being pretty new, Bake doesn't have as many tasks as Nant.  However, it does seem pretty easy to create tasks for Bake.  Plus, I have all the expressiveness of a programming language available to me now

I did have one glitch that is worth mentioning:  the task to compile my code was using the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/boo-build-system/issues/detail?id=3">CSC.EXE from .NET 2.0</a>.  This is a problem when you're working with a .NET 3.5 codebase.  But, no fear, I hacked out a quick fix inside of about 15 minutes, and all is well again.

I imagine that someone soon will blog about using Rake to build your .NET projects.  I eagerly await such a post.  In the meantime, I'm going to continue on with Bake, and see if it will meet my needs.

* <em>NOTE:  I lump MSBuild in with NAnt as MSBuild, IMHO, is a clone of NAnt</em><em>.</em>

		<p><a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/">Jeremy Miller</a> talking about the trials and tribulations of keeping a <a href="http://structuremap.sourceforge.net/Default.htm">codebase</a> viable and useful over the past four years.&#160; A lot of tips and explanations were backed with diagrams on the whiteboard.&#160; Kind of hard to blog that stuff, so this will probably be just a collection of bullets.</p>  <p>Lessons learned - a lot of them relate back to what are considered good, OO practices:</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>, especially with the very small things.&#160; When Jeremy was adding support for .NET 2.0, the generic support was problematic.&#160;&#160; <br />Example:&#160; Want to resolve a Repository&lt;T&gt;.&#160; You can't just look for the class Repository`1: i.e. was trying to resolve the class by using&#160; typeof(Repository`1).&#160; This did not work. </li>    <li><a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TellDontAsk">Tell, Don't Ask</a>.&#160; Didn't follow this to heavily at first, and so now effort has to be taken to rewrite code to adhere to this principle. </li>    <li>Using a lot of Double Dispatch (<em>hah!&#160; look Jeremy the picture did turn out</em>):       <br /><a href="http://www.opgenorth.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/SSPX0289_2.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="SSPX0289_2" border="0" alt="SSPX0289_2" src="http://www.opgenorth.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/SSPX0289_2_thumb.png" width="244" height="222" /></a> </li>    <li>If you need to refactor, do it now.&#160; Procrastination only makes it (refactoring) harder and more costly. </li>    <li>If you want to build a .NET framework and keep it around for four to five years, you should probably learn a bit about the fundamentals of .NET. </li>    <li>Small steps, frequent commits to source code. </li>    <li>Good solid battery of unit tests really helps with major changes. </li>    <li>Moving more towards coarser grained tests.&#160; Does the test check the functionality?&#160; Not to worried about the intermediate steps.      <ul>       <li>Assertions based on side effects really don't work well.&#160; Not very expressive, sometimes hard to figure out what what you're trying to test. </li>     </ul>   </li>    <li>It helps have tooling inside your tests in order to help you quickly create tests, especially the difficult to setup/create tests.&#160; Will result in a faster feedback cycle.&#160; This infrastructure is more strategic, can be very help. </li>    <li>Jeremy recommends &quot;Pragmatic Programmers&quot; </li> </ul>  <p>Brief discussion about where to start learning all these pattern.&#160; Advice is given to learn principles first (DRY, OCP, SRP, SOC, etc) as this will greatly help with the understanding and proper use of design patterns.</p>

		<p>Two topics merged into one.&#160; Rod Paddock wants to talk about stored procs, and others want to learn how to explain NHibernate to other people who aren't familiar with it (and minimize the jargon).</p>  <p>Rod uses a custom code-gen solution based heavily on sprocs - a data driven approach.&#160; Sounds like it works well for him.&#160; Oren concurs that this technique could be very effective in certain circumstances.&#160; It will have problems with complex situations that deal with convoluted/difficult data scenarios.&#160; He's giving an example, but I just can't keep up with him.&#160; The point of Oren's story is that a domain driven approach will would better when you're not dealing with data but with data and behavior.</p>

		<p>In my last post, I described how easy jQuery makes it to call an ASP.NET Web Service via AJAX.</p>  <p>Currently, I'm developing on Windows XP (SP2), Resharper 4 (running inside Visual Studio 2008), and using the Visual Studio Web Server.&#160; We deploy to Windows 2003 R2/IIS6.&#160; When I pushed the code described in my last post to the development server to test it out there, the web service call kept failing with an HTTP Status of 500 (internal error).&#160; This basically means something went wrong on the server.</p>
