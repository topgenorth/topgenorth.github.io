As one would expect, this stuff is fairly inexpensive as well, running around $0.50/round. I don&amp;rsquo;t think this is &amp;ldquo;precision ammo&amp;rdquo;, but it works well enough in my rifle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, I pulled one bullet apart, and weight it. The projecticle itself weight 146.1 grains, so I guess this is supposed to be 147gr ammo. I measured ~ 42.0 grains of &amp;ldquo;mystery gun powder&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Ballistics of Norinco 7.62x39</title><link>https://topgenorth.github.io/posts/ballistics-of-norinco-762x39/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 May 2017 19:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://topgenorth.github.io/posts/ballistics-of-norinco-762x39/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;On of the great things about 7.62x39mm rifles (like the SKS) is that (at the time of writing) ammo is fairly inexpensive. A fellow who keeps his eye open for a deal can find 7.62x39mm in the range of $0.16CAD (for corrosive) to $0.30CAD (for non-corrosive) ammo. Of course being surplus ammo, finding ballistics data on this ammunition can be a bit of a trick. Granted, the 7.62x39 cartridge isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly a &amp;ldquo;precision&amp;rdquo; round, but intellectual curiousity had me wondering what the ballistic coefficient (BC) of this Norinco ammo was.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
