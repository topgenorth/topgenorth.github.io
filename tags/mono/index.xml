&lt;p&gt;According to their website, Open Dental has been supported under Linux since v4.7.  Here are some notes of my efforts so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need Mono v1.2.5.  It seems that there is a problem with the Linux binary installer ( a known bug that will be corrected in 1.2.6).  I used the &lt;a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Downloads"&gt;OpenSUSE 10.2 VMWare image&lt;/a&gt; which had a 1.2.5 install all set up.  That solved my problem of getting a current Linux distro with the most recent version of Mono.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
