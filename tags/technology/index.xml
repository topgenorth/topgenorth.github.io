It&amp;rsquo;s best described as &amp;ldquo;spartan&amp;rdquo; (to say the least). As I&amp;rsquo;m used to full featured IDE&amp;rsquo;s I started looking for a replacement to the default Arduino IDE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are extensions to use Visual Studio, but that means me starting up a VM to run Windows which I don&amp;rsquo;t really want to do for Arduino development. There is a another IDE which looks promising called Maria Mole - but it&amp;rsquo;s Windows only so not really a contender for me. I need something for OS X. I looked at setting up Eclipse as my default IDE, but ran into some issues with that. Nothing to major, but as I don&amp;rsquo;t like Eclipse in the first place I wasn&amp;rsquo;t to motivated to sort things out, so I abandoned Eclipse as an IDE choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next thing I tried was &lt;a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/"&gt;Sublime Text&lt;/a&gt;. There is an Ardunio plugin called &lt;a href="https://github.com/Robot-Will/Stino"&gt;Stino&lt;/a&gt; that turns Sublime into a not bad IDE. In terms of writing your programs, Stino can pretty much do everything the Arduino IDE can do: compile programs, upload them to your Arduino board, import libraries, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
