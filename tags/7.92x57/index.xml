It is a improvement of the original 7.92x57mm cartridge that was developed in 1888 by Peter Paul Mauser. Arguably, 8mm Mauser has been one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most popular cartridges, having seen significant military and civilian use over the past 100+ year. It also influenced the design of many of today&amp;rsquo;s cartridges, such as .30-06.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding good 8mm Mauser ammunition (in Canada at least) is becoming harder. The glut of military surplus rifles and ammunition for this cartridge is long over, and there are more modern cartridges which have gained a significant following.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
