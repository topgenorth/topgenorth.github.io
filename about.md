I'm a software developer/programmer/contractor/consultant/nerd/geek who hails from Alberta, Canada. I've worked on a lot of different software projects in the past 20+ years in IT and have worn different hats - developer, QA, team lead, scapegoat, documenation, and even a bit of project management thrown in.

My background is primarily .NET, C# in particular. I was even a Microsoft MVP in C# from 2008 &ndash; 2010. However, I've also worked in C/++, Visual Basic, Java, Ruby, PHP, Perl, and a smattering of Python. It was in 2010 that I caught the mobile bug, Android in particular (although I do like iOS as well). 

Current I'm on contract to the great folks at Xamarin. If you're looking to make a **native** cross-platform mobile app, Xamarin is the only way to go IMHO.
