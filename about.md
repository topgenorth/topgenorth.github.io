I'm a software developer/programmer/contractor/consultant/nerd/geek who hails from Alberta, Canada. I've worked on a lot of different software projects in the past 20+ years in IT and have worn different hats - developer, QA, team lead, scapegoat, documentation, training and even a bit of project management thrown in.

My background is primarily .NET, C# in particular. I was even a Microsoft MVP in C# from 2008 &ndash; 2010. However, I've also worked in C/C++, Visual Basic, Java, Ruby, PHP, Perl, and a smattering of Python. It was in 2010 that I caught the mobile bug, Android in particular (although I do like iOS as well), and I've been trying to keep things focused on mobile in general.

From late 2011 to mid 2016, I was on contract to Xamarin. There, I worked with a great team to create great docs on how to do mobile development with Xamarin.Android, and how to test those apps using Xamarin Test Cloud. In mid 2016, Microsoft bought Xamarin, and I became a full time employee of Microsoft working with the same great team, until September 2018.
