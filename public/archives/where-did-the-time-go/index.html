However, they are hard hobbies to share with my sons at this point in time.&#160; So, at the start of winter I expanded the geek factor of my sons (and myself) by getting back into <a href="http://www.games-workshop.com">Warhammer</a>.&#160; Now the last time I played was about 20 years ago, with the 3rd edition rules.&#160; In fact, I still have some of the books in my basement from back then.&#160; Anyway, picked up <a href="http://www.games-workshop.com/gws/content/article.jsp?aId=700012a&amp;setLocale=en_CA&amp;amp;_requestid=1241948">The Battle for Skull Pass</a> boxed set.&#160; My son rather likes the <a href="http://www.games-workshop.com/gws/catalog/landingArmy.jsp?catId=cat210008&amp;rootCatGameStyle=">Dwarfs</a>.&#160; I suspect it’s because he’s similar in stature/height to the stunties.&#160; Myself, while I find the <a href="http://www.games-workshop.com/gws/catalog/landingArmy.jsp?catId=cat50030&amp;rootCatGameStyle=">Greenskins</a> amusing, I suspect I might have to move on and get serious with <a href="http://www.games-workshop.com/gws/catalog/landingArmy.jsp?catId=cat40032&amp;rootCatGameStyle=">Dark Elves</a>.</p>  <p>Anyway, enough for tonight.</p>
