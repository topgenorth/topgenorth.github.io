			<p><em>Note:&#160; I originally wrote this post on August 23, 2008.&#160; As things change with the book NHibernate in Action, I will be updating this post and resetting the date.&#160; </em></p>  <p>I'd like to take a break from boring you two readers of my blog about my experience with Linux and VMware, and take a moment to annoy you with a rant.&#160; Diversity is the spice of life after all.</p>  <p>This little remonstration of mine is about the <a href="http://www.manning.com/about/meap.html">Manning Early Access Program</a> (MEAP).&#160; Well, specifically just&#160; <a href="http://www.manning.com/kuate/">one book</a>.&#160; I've got my eye on a couple of other books available with MEAP to see how they pan out before considering the whole &quot;early access&quot; useless.&#160; Anyway...</p>  <p>It's been over a year ago that I &quot;bought&quot; a copy of the book <a href="http://www.manning.com/kuate/">NHibernate in Action</a>.&#160; I did so because I want a bit dissatisfied with the documentation for NHibernate 1.2, and thought that the book would help me.&#160; I wasn't an NHibernate virgin/noobie, but I did need some help with a couple of things, and I really didn't have a large network of NHibernate masters to turn to for help. </p>  <p>I was disappointed when I saw that the book wasn't in print yet.&#160; Then I was happy to see that I could order the book, download a PDF, and the hardcopy would be sent to me when the book went to print.&#160; Given that, in the summer of 2007 it was expected NHibernate in Action would be in print in late 2007, I thought it was reasonable to pay the money up front, and get the finished product mailed to me a couple of months later (I like to have hard copies of my books).</p>  <p>Well, here we are now, a year later.&#160; As of September 9th, 2008 writing, summer of 2008, the softbound print date for NHibernate In Action is schedule for December, 2008.&#160; Since I downloaded my PDF of the book in August of 2007, there has been a total of one updated PDF.</p>  <p>Now, I can understand when deadlines get missed, and stuff is late.&#160; But, I think that, with a technology book, being <strong><em>over one year late</em></strong> is inexcusable.&#160; A lot happens in one year in the programming space:&#160; <strike>NHibernate 2.0 is now in Alpha.&#160; What will be released first, NHibernate 2.0 or the printed copy of a book on NHibernate 1.2?</strike>&#160; <a href="http://www.ayende.com/Blog/archive/2008/08/23/NHibernate-2.0-Final-is-out.aspx">NHibernate 2.0 is now available</a>. </p>  <p>I think the money spent on the PDF was worth it, but I honestly feel I got hosed on the cash I paid out for the hardcopy.</p>  <p>I just can't help but feel that the extra money I paid to get a hardcopy of NHibernate in Action would probably have been better spent using the bills to make little origami swans, ducks, and platypuses and then floating them out to sea.</p>  <p>I will be watching a couple of other books of interest to me on MEAP.&#160; But, in all honesty, I don't think I will be buying any more books in this fashion until Manning Publications does something to restore my faith in their Early Access Program.&#160; I still my get the PDF's if I have an immediate need for them, but I can't see purchasing a book in this manner anymore.</p>  <p><em>Updated August 25, 2008:&#160; NHibernate 2.0 has been released</em></p>  <p><em>Updated September 9, 2008:&#160; I see that the softbound print date has changed from November, 2008 to December, 2008.</em></p>  <p><em>Updated September 19, 2008: </em></p>  <p>Well, I just got the following e-mail from Manning publications:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Dear NHibernate in Action MEAP customer,</p>    <p>NHibernate in Action is almost ready! The last updates have been submitted,      <br />the technical review is complete, and all chapters are in final production.       <br />Some of you have been working with the MEAP for over a year, but we expect       <br />the final ebook to be released in just over a month, with the print book to       <br />follow shortly thereafter.</p>    <p>We appreciate your participation in the MEAP and especially all the valuable      <br />feedback you provided in the Author Online forum. Your excellent comments       <br />helped shape the final book.</p>    <p>To thank you for your patience, we'd like to offer you a $15 Manning Gift      <br />Certificate to use for any print, ebook, or MEAP at Manning.com. Just enter       <br />&quot;_____&quot; in the Promotional Code box when you check out. The Gift       <br />Certificate will expire <em>October 1, 2008</em>.</p>    <p>Happy reading,</p>    <p>Manning Publications</p> </blockquote>  <p><em>(Note:&#160; I removed the promotional code from the e-mail and added emphasis on the expiry date)</em></p>  <p>I guess this is some sort of attempt at placating us for unacceptable amount of time this book has taken.&#160; Is it just me, or does anybody else see the irony in them thanking us for our patience with this book by telling us to hurry up and use the $15 Manning Gift Certificate?</p>
