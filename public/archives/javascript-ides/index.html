			<p>Lately I’ve found myself doing a lot more web application development in JavaScript.&#160; Typically, I always seem to fall back on plain old Notepad++ or Visual Studio.&#160; As a developer, the user experience in either is, IMHO, somewhat lacking. </p>  <p>However, for the past week, I’ve been using <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/index.html">RubyMine</a>.&#160; <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/index.html">RubyMine</a> is a Ruby on Rails IDE from <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com">Jetbrains</a>, but it seems to work rather well for editing JavaScript and HTML files.&#160; Plus, as an added bonus, it automatically comes with built in support for <a href="http://www.jquery.com">jQuery</a>.</p>  <p>Curious about <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/index.html">RubyMine</a>?&#160; Why not come to the <a href="http://www.edmontoncodecamp.com/">Edmonton Code Camp</a> on November 29th, 2008 and see it in action during my presentation on <a href="http://www.jquery.com">jQuery</a>?&#160; Or better yet, download your own copy and check it out.</p>  <p>&lt;rant&gt;    <br />Now this may strike the one or two readers of blog as odd (assuming they haven’t fallen asleep or navigated away by now) – a lot of what I do is ASP.NET Development (WebForms and ASP.NET MVC), so shouldn’t I have been doing a lot of JavaScript up to now?</p>  <p>Well, if you allow me to digress a bit, my answer to that is “No”.&#160; I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again that, as a web developer relying very heavily on WebForms in the past, nothing has done more to emasculate my JavaScript skills than Microsoft’s ASP.NET WebForms.&#160; ASP.NET Webforms, with it’s emphasis on making development as VB6-like as possible, seems to encourage you do try and do everything server-side.&#160; I know that I’ve sat in on at least one presentation by Microsoft employees who have spoken disparagingly of JavaScript.&#160; This is just plain wrong, IMHO.&#160; Ask me why in person, if you’d like to hear the full rant.</p>  <p>Note:&#160; This is my opinion.&#160; Lots of people are happy with Webforms, and if you are, good for you.&#160; I’m not.&#160; Direct all comments and opinions on my viewpoint to /dev/null.&#160; </p>  <p>Of course, this rant doesn’t apply if you’re using ASP.NET MVC or MonoRail.    <br />&lt;/rant&gt;</p>  <p><em><strong>Updated August 10, 2010</strong> : A bit of time has passed since I first wrote this post, figured an update couldn’t hurt</em></p>  <p>These days I seem to use a combination of <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> and <a href="http://getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a>.&#160; Firebug truly rocks.&#160; It would be really nice if it worked for Internet Explorer, but it’s probably more realistic to hope for universal peace or an end to world hunger.&#160; I’m told IE9 is supposed to have some good stuff for JavaScript development, but I somehow doubt that will help me out when I have to debug IE7/IE8 issues.</p>  <p>I’ve had some people in the past suggest Visual Studio 2008 whenever I do an informal poll.&#160; Personally, I’ve found the JavaScript editing experience in VS2008 to be lacklustre at best.&#160; </p>  <p>When <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">WebStorm</a> was in beta, I tried that combined with Firebug.&#160; I rather liked it for my JavaScript editing needs.&#160; </p>  <p>If you have any favourite tools (or IDE’s) to help with your JavaScript/jQuery development, I sure would like to hear about it.</p>
