			<p>I have a <a href="http://www.samsung.com/global/microsite/gear/gearlive_design.html">Samsung Gear Live</a>. One day, all of sudden, it wouldn&rsquo;t turn on after I had it charging in it&rsquo;s little charging dock. I thought the problem was with the watch, and Google the symptoms led me to one of two conclusions:</p>
<ol>
<li>The watch was defective, and I should send it back under warranty.</li>
<li>I could fix the problem by taking the watch apart, disconnecting the battery for a minute, and then reconnecting the battery. Or something like that.</li>
</ol>
<p>I was a bit dismayed that for a device not even a year old that these were my options. I was mulling over the options, and I flipped the watch over to see what tools I would need to take the watch apart (who doesn&rsquo;t like disassembling electronics), when I notice that the contact points on the watch were filthy (as one the NCOs on my infantry course used to say when inspecting rifles – &ldquo;crud, corruption, and communism&rdquo;). You can see the contacts for the charging dock right in the picture below:</p>

<p>I figured cleaning these contact points was easier than taking the watch apart and quicker than sending the watch back, so I grabbed an eraser and gave the contacts a quick scrub.  I plugged the watch back into the charging cradle, and all of a sudden it started charging again.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had to do this a couple of times now. I recently found out that some erasers may leave a thin film of residue that may attract dirt. There are a couple of options available:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Rubbing alcohol and a Q-Tip</strong>. One fellow I work with will clean the back of his watch every week with this.</li>
<li><strong>CAIG Deoxit</strong>. Another co-worker with an electronics background suggested <a href="http://www.parts-express.com/caig-deoxit-d5s-6-spray-5-oz--341-200?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=pla">Deoxit</a> by Caig. Put a bit on a Q-Tip, and then clean away. This product will not only clean the contacts and remove oxidation but will leave behind a thin layer to help prevent oxidation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Anybody else experienced this problem with their watch? What solutions did you use?</p>
