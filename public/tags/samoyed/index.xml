      <description>&lt;p&gt;Life has been a bit busy as of late.&amp;#160; On Sept 4, 2010 a little monster invaded my house.&amp;#160; A savage beast, suitably evolved for our Canadian winters and a fearless hunter of snow-snakes.&amp;#160; Oh, that, and it turns out that she is a distant cousin to my last dog Bailey.&amp;#160; This is my new puppy Casey, who is just shy of 9 weeks old.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.opgenorth.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9050049.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img style=&#34;border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px&#34; title=&#34;P9050049&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;P9050049&#34; src=&#34;http://www.opgenorth.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9050049_thumb.jpg&#34; width=&#34;436&#34; height=&#34;328&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, today was a rather sad around the household.&amp;#160; This morning I had to take &lt;a href=&#34;http://picasaweb.google.ca/opgenorth/Bailey&#34;&gt;Bailey&lt;/a&gt;, my dog, to the vet to be put down.&amp;#160; She had just turned 14 years old in September of this year, and age had finally caught up with her.&amp;#160; Her hips were going and we were getting concerned that one day she would be stuck on the floor and wouldn&#39;t be able to walk anymore.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
