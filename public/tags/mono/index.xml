      <description>&lt;p&gt;The past week I&#39;ve been dabbling with an open source program called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.open-dent.com/&#34;&gt;Open Dental&lt;/a&gt; - mostly trying to see if can get it to compile under Mono, and running under Linux.&amp;#160; I figure that this would be a good opportunity to and work with a cross platform application. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;According to their website, Open Dental has been supported under Linux since v4.7.&amp;#160; Here are some notes of my efforts so far.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You will need Mono v1.2.5.&amp;#160; It seems that there is a problem with the Linux binary installer ( a known bug that will be corrected in 1.2.6).&amp;#160; I used the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mono-project.com/Downloads&#34;&gt;OpenSUSE 10.2 VMWare image&lt;/a&gt; which had a 1.2.5 install all set up.&amp;#160; That solved my problem of getting a current Linux distro with the most recent version of Mono.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
