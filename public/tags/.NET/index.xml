      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m currently working on a project where there are some functional tests that require a SQL Server database. Before in the past I’ve always handled this by using Redgate’s excellent SQL Server tools to create a monolithic script that would deploy the DB Schema, and then another set of scripts to set up the data.&amp;#160; Then it’s pretty trivial to use OSQL.EXE to run the scripts and setup the database.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>First Impressions: Windows Phone 7 Development</title>

      <description>I’ve spent a bit of my spare time in the past week looking at Windows Phone 7 from a developer’s point of view.  I’d have started sooner, but honestly, I didn’t see the point until there were actually devices that I could hold and use.  I know that in the U.S., some guys got developer phones from Microsoft, but I don’t think that anybody up here in Canada was that lucky.&#xA;&#xA;So, over the past year or so I’ve been dabbling with Android and I actually like programming for Android.  The biggest issues I’ve run into with Android are my lack of Java skills – I keep doing things the C# way (you really don’t realize how handy Linq is until you don’t have it) and the fact that Android doesn’t have a decent UI designer.  But otherwise, I like Android.&#xA;&#xA;So, I was curious what the developer experience was for WP7.  In a nutshell – it’s not bad, and in some ways better than that of Android.&#xA;&#xA;Things I like about WP7 development:&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;li&gt;Being a C# guy, it was pretty easy and fast for me to get going with WP7.  Of course, Novell now has &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.monodroid.net&#34;&gt;MonoDroid&lt;/a&gt; which in theory should lessen the learning curve for a C# guy to create Android applications.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;li&gt;It’s nice to have good tooling to help with creating my UI’s.  Blend and Cider are pretty decent. Android does have &lt;a href=&#34;http://droiddraw.org&#34;&gt;DroidDraw&lt;/a&gt;, but I’ve never really found that tool to be good to work with.  Eclipse has some sort of an GUI designer thingy, but again, I’ve found it to be kind of lack-lustre at best.  That, and I don’t use Eclipse – I prefer IntelliJ.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;li&gt;The Emulator seems to start up faster to me that the Android emulator – but that could just be me.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;li&gt;The MVVM pattern.  I know the theory, and am now learning the more practical side of it.  Was worried that WP7 was going to decent into the path of darkness and pain that was/is Web Forms.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;li&gt;I think that the debugger integrates better with the WP7 emulator.  Not that, generally speaking, I spend a lot of time in the debugger, but when you need it, it does seem to be more natural to me.  Again, this could just be because by day I do a lot of C# development so I’m more used to the Microsoft tooling to begin with.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;Some things I didn’t like about WP7 development:&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;li&gt;You have to have Vista or Windows 7.  Yes, I know, XP is almost 10 years old, time to move on.  Call me an O/S curmudgeon.  I don’t mind Windows 7, but Vista sucks/sucked.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;li&gt;It seems like to build your apps, you have to use Visual Studio 2010.  Not a problem for a developer, but I’m old school when it comes to compiling applications, and your build server shouldn’t be tainted by your IDE.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;li&gt;I’m use to the relatively easy going Google marketplace and the fact I have numerous avenues available to me to distribute Android applications.  No such joy with WP7 apps.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;li&gt;Editing XAML by hand.  But, I suppose it’s no worse that the XML resource files that Android uses.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;li&gt;Not seeing a lot of projects whose code I can read.  Granted it’s still early, so hopefully that will change.  Or not.  .NET doesn’t seem to have the same OSS community spirit that Java does.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;Microsoft has always tried to be pretty good to developers (sometimes to their own detriment), but I think Windows Phone 7 does have some things going for it, from a developer’s point of view anyway.  Here’s to hoping that strategy pays off – that cool apps will get written for WP7, and that it will be commercially viable.  Competition is good – it will keep Apple and Google on their toes.  &lt;img class=&#34;wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile&#34; style=&#34;border-style: none;&#34; src=&#34;http://www.opgenorth.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/wlEmoticon-smile.png&#34; alt=&#34;Smile&#34; /&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I guess I forgot to mention this:&amp;#160; On April 1, 2010, I received an e-mail from Microsoft that my &lt;a href=&#34;https://mvp.support.microsoft.com/profile=31F1E181-79EC-4497-B792-FA8F83D34936&#34;&gt;MVP in C#&lt;/a&gt; was renewed for the third year.&amp;#160; This makes me a happy, because with Resharper 5 (and therefore Visual Studio 2010) and Windows Mobile 7, I’m hoping that this will be an exciting year for the .NET crowd.&amp;#160; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Well, okay, perhaps I didn’t forget.&amp;#160; Given that it was April 1st when I got the e-mail, I like to give things a few days to settle down.&amp;#160; I am acquainted with some mischievous pranksters who would think it was a funny April Fools joke.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Followup: TechDays 2009 in Calgary</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/archives/techdays-2009-in-calgary-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 19 Nov 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/archives/techdays-2009-in-calgary-2/</guid>
      <description>Yesterday I was at TechDays 2009 in Calgary for the day (well, the morning really).  I wasn&#39;t there as an attendee, but as a speaker.  Thanks to everybody who came out to my two talks, the first one on an &lt;em&gt;Introduction to ASP.NET MVC&lt;/em&gt; and the second one on &lt;em&gt;SOLIDifying your ASP.NET MVC Application&lt;/em&gt;.  There were a few hiccups along the way:  as usual, I fell victim to the Technical Presentation Time Dilation Syndrome (i.e. ran out of time) on both talks.  I guess I&#39;m just to long-winded for my own good.  As well, because I was running a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/ReSharper/ReSharper+Early+Access+Program&#34;&gt;EAP of Resharper 5&lt;/a&gt;, I had some Visual Studio 2008 issues - namely VS2008 would hang on me from time to time.  Note to self: maybe don&#39;t use the bleeding edge tools in a talk.  And I really should break myself of wanting to type all the code - using snippets would really save me time.&#xA;&#xA;Two things that suprised me:&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;li&gt;That there was still that much interest in ASP.NET MVC intro talks.  I just figured that everybody knew/knows about it.  Or maybe I just spend to much time with guys who have drunk the ASP.NET MVC Flavor Aid.  Either way, I think that there were some in the crowd that will convert from WebForms to ASP.NET MVC.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;li&gt;I asked how many people wrote unit tests or developing their software using Test Driven Development was the number of people who didn&#39;t raise their hands.  While I didn&#39;t expect the majority of the crowd, I did expect a lot more people than I saw.  Maybe it was a quiet crowd, and people didn&#39;t feel like saying they wrote unit tests.  Maybe I live in a bubble, and my perception of what is actually going on in the .NET world is skewed (that is to say, perhaps writing tests is the exception rather than the rule).  It did kind of make me a bit concerned, as I truly believe that TDD does help one write better software overall.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;Anyway, here&#39;s to hoping that TechDays 2010 will stop off in Edmonton.  And hopefully have a track that will focus on developer fundamentals, like TechDays had in Toronto and Vancouver.&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;zemanta-pixie&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;zemanta-pixie-img&#34; src=&#34;http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=2eb31f71-f855-83ff-bf64-795e87c1b4f0&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Compiling ASP.NET MVC on Mono 2.4.3</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Out of intellectual curiosity, I sparked up &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.monodevelop.com&#34;&gt;MonoDevelop&lt;/a&gt; and decided to see what would happen when I tried to compile the &lt;a href=&#34;http://aspnet.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=24471&#34;&gt;ASP.NET MVC source code&lt;/a&gt;. I figured that it would Just Work.&amp;#160; After all, I can use the .NET compiled assembly with no problems on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.go-mono.com&#34;&gt;Mono&lt;/a&gt;, so there really shouldn&#39;t be any problems trying to compile the code.&amp;#160; Bad news is that there is one minor glitch.&amp;#160; Good news is the glitch is easy to work around and has already been fixed so it shouldn&#39;t be a problem for future version of Mono. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Just a heads up that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/canada/techdays/default.aspx&#34;&gt;TechDays Canada 2009&lt;/a&gt; is happening in Calgary next week on November 17 and 18.  Yours truly will be there for the whole morning of November 18th talking about ASP.NET MVC and SOLID (note that this is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; the same SOLID talk from the DevFundamentals track at TechDays Vancouver and TechDays Toronto).  If you happen to be there, don&#39;t be afraid to come on by and say hello.&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;zemanta-pixie&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;zemanta-pixie-img&#34; src=&#34;http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=398917f8-5ef2-8681-9044-b9ab8d709d26&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Edmonton Code Camp: What Do You Want?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, it’s coming up on fall, which is traditionally the time of year for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.edmontoncodecamp.com&#34;&gt;Edmonton Code Camp&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160; It seems that there is still a spot or two left for speakers, so if you’re in Edmonton why not think of something programmy and give a talk.&amp;#160; Doesn’t have to be .NET – anything that is related to software development will do.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Anyway, I’ve put my name down for a talk at ECC.&amp;#160; There are several options available for me and I’m not sure which one to go with.&amp;#160; So, I figured that perhaps a straw poll would help me decide.&amp;#160; Feel free to add a comment about which topic you’d prefer:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the nice things about &lt;a href=&#34;http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html&#34;&gt;Dependency Injection&lt;/a&gt; is that it can really help write a more flexible, modular application.&amp;#160; These days, it seems that there is no shortage of choice in the .NET community when it comes to IoC frameworks:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://structuremap.sourceforge.net&#34;&gt;StructureMap&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.castleproject.org/container/index.html&#34;&gt;Castle Windsor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ninject.org&#34;&gt;Ninject&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/autofac/&#34;&gt;Autofac&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.codeplex.com/unity&#34;&gt;Unity&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.springframework.net/&#34;&gt;Spring.NET&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;And probably others that I’m missing. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ironically, when you first start using an IoC framework, you might find that in trying to make a loosely-coupled, modular, application you end up shackling yourself to the framework you’re using for IoC. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Every Time you [Ignore] a Test, a Puppy Dies</title>

      <description>&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.opgenorth.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/image001_2.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img style=&#34;display: inline; border: 0px;&#34; title=&#34;image001_2&#34; src=&#34;http://www.opgenorth.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/image001_2_thumb.jpg&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;image001_2&#34; width=&#34;244&#34; height=&#34;174&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&#xA;If you using a unit testing framework such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nunit.org&#34;&gt;NUnit&lt;/a&gt;, you&#39;re no doubt familiar with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nunit.org/index.php?p=ignore&amp;amp;r=2.4.8&#34;&gt;[Ignore]&lt;/a&gt; attribute.  (Note:  I haven&#39;t used &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mbunit.com&#34;&gt;MbUnit&lt;/a&gt; in a while, but I&#39;m pretty sure that all this applies there as well.) For those who aren&#39;t, when you adorn your [Test] with this attribute, then your test runner should pay no heed to this particular [Test].  Instead of going green or red, your test turns up as yellow in your test runner. At first blush, this seems handy - rather than deleting a failing or broken test you can have it [Ignore]d, much like your typical computer geek at a high school dance before the punch get&#39;s spiked. Now you can deal with the wayward test on your own time with the pesky failure cluttering up your CI build (you do have a CI build box set up, right?).&#xA;&#xA;Please bear with me while I submit to you: This isn&#39;t a good idea. This is a bad idea. An ugly idea. The kind of bad, ugly idea than even &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.igloocoder.com&#34;&gt;Belcham&lt;/a&gt;-esque quantities of scotch couldn&#39;t make pretty. Why? Well, the whole point to having a unit test is to &lt;strong&gt;test something&lt;/strong&gt;. If your test is failing, that means something is broken.  You should be addressing the cause of the failure and dealing with the problem now. Covering up the failure with some attribute kind of defeats the purpose of having the unit test in the first place. I mean, really, if you had open, festering lesions on your skin would you just cover them up with a band-aid and pretend nothing was wrong?  Odds are you&#39;d go to a doctor and get that checked out.&#xA;&#xA;Alternately, perhaps the test isn&#39;t valid anymore: your application has changed/evolved and the code that you were testing isn&#39;t around anymore. Then, get rid of the test! Delete it from your test fixtures, and don&#39;t look back.&#xA;&#xA;Granted the world we live in is not black and while.  Sometimes we&#39;re working on things, and we only want tests to run when it is explicitly asked to run.  To handle this scenario, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nunit.org&#34;&gt;NUnit&lt;/a&gt; provides the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nunit.org/index.php?p=explicit&amp;amp;r=2.4.8&#34;&gt;[Explicit]&lt;/a&gt; attribute.  This is a kinder, more gentle kind of ignore.  This instructs &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nunit.org&#34;&gt;NUnit&lt;/a&gt; to only run the test when it is told to run the test.  If you add a comment to the attribute, then it helps those going through the build log understand why the test is being run.  However it is still possible to run the test if desired.&#xA;&lt;pre style=&#34;border: 1px solid #cecece; padding: 5px; overflow: auto; background-color: #fbfbfb; min-height: 40px; width: 650px;&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre style=&#34;margin: 0em; background-color: #fbfbfb; width: 100%; font-family: consolas,&#39;Courier New&#39;,courier,monospace; font-size: 12px;&#34;&gt;[Explicit(&#34;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #8b0000;&#34;&gt;This test takes a really really really long time to run so we don&#39;t want to run it in this test suite every time&lt;/span&gt;&#34;)]&#xA;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre style=&#34;margin: 0em; background-color: #fbfbfb; width: 100%; font-family: consolas,&#39;Courier New&#39;,courier,monospace; font-size: 12px;&#34;&gt;[Test]&#xA;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre style=&#34;margin: 0em; background-color: #fbfbfb; width: 100%; font-family: consolas,&#39;Courier New&#39;,courier,monospace; font-size: 12px;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #0000ff;&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #0000ff;&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; My_very_important_test()&#xA;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre style=&#34;margin: 0em; background-color: #fbfbfb; width: 100%; font-family: consolas,&#39;Courier New&#39;,courier,monospace; font-size: 12px;&#34;&gt;{&#xA;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre style=&#34;margin: 0em; background-color: #fbfbfb; width: 100%; font-family: consolas,&#39;Courier New&#39;,courier,monospace; font-size: 12px;&#34;&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color: #008000;&#34;&gt;// Test valuable things here&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre style=&#34;margin: 0em; background-color: #fbfbfb; width: 100%; font-family: consolas,&#39;Courier New&#39;,courier,monospace; font-size: 12px;&#34;&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;I know some people are going to protest my advice.

      <title>Common Sevice Locator</title>

      <description>One of the nice things about &lt;a href=&#34;http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html&#34;&gt;Dependency Injection&lt;/a&gt; is that it can really help write a more flexible, modular application.  These days, it seems that there is no shortage of choice in the .NET community when it comes to IoC frameworks:&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://structuremap.sourceforge.net&#34;&gt;StructureMap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.castleproject.org/container/index.html&#34;&gt;Castle Windsor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ninject.org&#34;&gt;Ninject&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/autofac/&#34;&gt;Autofac&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.codeplex.com/unity&#34;&gt;Unity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.springframework.net/&#34;&gt;Spring.NET&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;li&gt;And probably others that I&#39;m missing.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;Ironically, when you first start using an IoC framework, you might find that in trying to make a loosely-coupled, modular, application you end up shackling yourself to the framework you&#39;re using for IoC.&#xA;&#xA;For example, you start off using your own homegrown IoC framework, and then decide at some point in the future to use a different framework, like say StructureMap.  Going through your codebase to make these changes can be quite the exercise in pain.&#xA;&#xA;There are a couple of ways to isolate yourself from this kind of situation.  I won&#39;t get into all of them but instead will focus on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.codeplex.com/CommonServiceLocator&#34;&gt;Common Service Locator&lt;/a&gt;. What is Common Service Locator?  Well, allow me to cut and paste some text from the web site:&#xA;&#xA;&#34;&lt;em&gt;The Common Service Locator library contains a shared interface for service location which application and framework developers can reference. The library provides an abstraction over IoC containers and service locators. Using the library allows an application to indirectly access the capabilities without relying on hard references. The hope is that using this library, third-party applications and frameworks can begin to leverage IoC/Service Location without tying themselves down to a specific implementation.&lt;/em&gt;&#34;&#xA;&#xA;Blah blah blah - so what does all that mean?  Well, in my own words, CSL is basically a wrapper around your IoC container which separates how you  initialize/configure your IoC container from how you use it.  This separation allows you to use your IoC container without knowing anything about it.&#xA;&#xA;This separation is achieved by use of adapters for the particular IoC container that you want to use.  These adapters are what do the dirty work of finding the service you need, in their own special way and totally transparent from your application code.  Currently, the Common Service Locator has adapters for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.codeplex.com/CommonServiceLocator/Wiki/View.aspx?title=StructureMap%20Adapter&amp;amp;referringTitle=Home&#34;&gt;StructureMap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.codeplex.com/CommonServiceLocator/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Castle%20Windsor%20Adapter&amp;amp;referringTitle=Home&#34;&gt;Castle Windows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.codeplex.com/CommonServiceLocator/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Unity%20Adapter&amp;amp;referringTitle=Home&#34;&gt;Unity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.codeplex.com/CommonServiceLocator/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Spring%20.NET%20Adapter&amp;amp;referringTitle=Home&#34;&gt;Spring.NET&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.codeplex.com/CommonServiceLocator/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Autofac%20Adapter&amp;amp;referringTitle=Home&#34;&gt;autofac&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;&#xA;Now, allow me an example of using the Common Service Locator with StructureMap. There is no special reason as to why StructureMap - it just happens to be what I find myself using these days.&#xA;&#xA;Now, say I use the the following &lt;a href=&#34;http://structuremap.sourceforge.net/RegistryDSL.htm&#34;&gt;registry&lt;/a&gt; to configure StructureMap:&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;   1: public class DefaultStructureMapRegistry: Registry&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;   2: {&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;   3:     public DefaultStructureMapRegistry()&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;   4:     {&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;   5:         ForRequestedType&amp;lt;IDb4oConfiguration&amp;gt;()&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;   6:             .TheDefaultIsConcreteType&amp;lt;SimpleDb4oConfiguration&amp;gt;();&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;   7:     }&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;   8: }&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;In a nutshell this says that every time StructureMap is asked to provided an object of type IDb4oConfiguration, it should instantiate a SimpleDb4oConfiguration object and return that.  So, to get an instance of IDb4oConfiguration with StructureMap, I would do something like this:&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;   1: var db4oConfig = ObjectFactory.GetInstance&amp;lt;IDb4oConfiguration&amp;gt;();&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;Pretty simple, but it does kind of tightly couples me to StructureMap.  If I need/feel like/am forced at gunpoint to change my IoC container to something that is Not StructureMap, you can bet that there will be much wailing and gnashing of teeth on my part as I hunt through my code to make these changes.&#xA;&#xA;Now enter the Common Service Locator.  First, let&#39;s take a peek at some interfaces for CSL.  First an interface:&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;   1: namespace Microsoft.Practices.ServiceLocation&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;   2: {&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;   3:     public interface IServiceLocator : IServiceProvider&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;   4:     {&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;   5:         object GetInstance(Type serviceType);&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;   6:         object GetInstance(Type serviceType, string key);&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;   7:         IEnumerable&amp;lt;object&amp;gt; GetAllInstances(Type serviceType);&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;   8:         TService GetInstance&amp;lt;TService&amp;gt;();&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;   9:         TService GetInstance&amp;lt;TService&amp;gt;(string key);&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;  10:         IEnumerable&amp;lt;TService&amp;gt; GetAllInstances&amp;lt;TService&amp;gt;();&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;  11:     }&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;  12: }&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;The IServiceLocator is an interface that your application will use when it requests something from your IoC container.&#xA;&#xA;Another thing that CSL provides is a static class that your application would use to use a current IServiceLocator to request services.  That static class looks something like:&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;   1: namespace Microsoft.Practices.ServiceLocation&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;   2: {&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;   3:     public static class ServiceLocator&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;   4:     {&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;   5:         public static IServiceLocator Current { get; }&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;   6:         public static void SetLocatorProvider(ServiceLocatorProvider newProvider) {};&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;   7:     }&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;   8: }&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;So, now lets see how we would request the default implementation of the IDb4oConfiguration service using CSL.  First, we would initialize CSL:&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;   1: var registry = new DefaultStructureMapRegistry();&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;   2: var container = new global::StructureMap.Container(registry);&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;   3: var smServiceLocator = new StructureMapServiceLocator(container);&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;   4: ServiceLocator.SetLocatorProvider(() =&amp;gt; smServiceLocator );&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;What is going on here? Allow me to provide a quick line by line explanation:&#xA;&#xA;Line 1 we instantiate a new StructureMap registry.  We then feed that registry to a StructureMap container in line 2.  With line 3, we see that StructureMap container is then fed to the StructureMapServiceLocator, which is the SM adapter for the Common Service Locator.  Finally, with line 4 we provide a lambda that CSL will use to fulfill future requests for services.&#xA;&#xA;Now when our application wants to get an instance of IDb4oConfiguration it just politely asks CSL:&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;   1: var db4oConfig = ServiceLocator.Current.GetService&amp;lt;IDb4oConfiguration&amp;gt;();&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;Pretty simple and clean, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eh#Canada&#34;&gt;eh&lt;/a&gt;?  Now, when radical group the &lt;em&gt;Foundation for Unity as the Dominate IoC Container&lt;/em&gt; sneaks into your cube and forces you at the point of a nerf gun to switch to Unity, you can do so with minimal disruption to your application. With a properly layered application, it would be as simple as coding a new UnityConfiguration layer and then using that instead of your StructureMapConfiguration layer on application startup.&#xA;&#xA;Now, granted this is pretty trivialized example.  There are other ways to solve this problem, but CSL does seem to take are of the grunt work for you so that you can just get going with things.</description>

      <description>Well, in a scant few hours I&#39;ll be off to Austin, Texas, for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.KaizenConf.com&#34;&gt;KaizenConf&lt;/a&gt;.  It will be a fun packed couple of day dealing with some very &lt;a href=&#34;http://codebetter.com/blogs/david_laribee/archive/2008/10/27/kaizenconf-workshops-schedule.aspx&#34;&gt;interesting topics&lt;/a&gt;.  In all honestly, I don&#39;t exactly know which of the topics I want to attend - the pretty much all are of interest to me.  Makes me wish I could clone myself.&#xA;&#xA;My plane lands early afternoon, so if you&#39;re kicking around Austin and want to entertain an easily amused Canuck, give me a holler (comments here, or on twitter).</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I was driving home today, I couldn&#39;t help notice something.&amp;#160; Microsoft&#39;s ASP.NET MVC framework is still in beta, and was only announced last October.&amp;#160; To my knowledge, there are currently three projects in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://maps.google.ca/maps?q=Edmonton,+Alberta&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;ll=53.540307,-113.510742&amp;amp;spn=18.606218,57.128906&amp;amp;z=5&amp;amp;iwloc=addr&#34;&gt;Edmonton&lt;/a&gt; area based off this framework.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Castle Monorail has been around for much longer, three years or so?&amp;#160; It&#39;s still listed as a release candidate on it&#39;s website, but I&#39;d say Monorail is suitable for production.&amp;#160; Currently, I am not aware of any projects in the Edmonton that are based off this framework.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night (Thursday, June 26th) &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.dashpoint.com/&#34;&gt;Rod Paddock&lt;/a&gt; gave a talk on using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.silverlight.net&#34;&gt;Silverlight&lt;/a&gt; 2.0 to the Edmonton .NET User Group.&amp;#160; I&#39;d say that Rod did a pretty good job, despite the fact that the beta of both &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.silverlight.net&#34;&gt;Silverlight&lt;/a&gt; and Expression Blend didn&#39;t exactly want to play nice all the time.&amp;#160; It&#39;s definitely perked my interest in the technology, and I can see a lot of business potential for it. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The rich user experience that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.silverlight.net&#34;&gt;Silverlight&lt;/a&gt; brings to the web-browser, will, I think raise the bar for what web applications will do for businesses.&amp;#160; Forget all the buzz about ASP.NET MVC or MonoRail or ASP.NET 3.5.&amp;#160; This is just another layer of makeup on the tired, old, hooker that is application development in .NET.&amp;#160; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.silverlight.net&#34;&gt;Silverlight&lt;/a&gt; is what will make business users oh and ah and get excited about web apps again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As far as web developer&#39;s go, I&#39;ll freely admit that my Javascript is not one of my strong points.&amp;#160; I don&#39;t have a real good reason for this, it&#39;s just that over the past few years I haven&#39;t had much call/need to polish and hone my Javascript skills.&amp;#160; Recently I discovered &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jquery.com&#34;&gt;jQuery&lt;/a&gt;, and I must say that I wish I had know about this library earlier.&amp;#160; The more I use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jquery.com&#34;&gt;jQuery&lt;/a&gt;, the more I like it.&amp;#160; The simple things are simple, and the hard things are possible.&amp;#160; Take calling a simple webservice when the user clicks a button on a form.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On the Functional Apex of Mainstream Build Tools in .NET</title>

      <description>Wordy title.  To wordy.  Kind of like build files these days.&#xA;&#xA;I remember when I first discovered Ant, and then &lt;a href=&#34;http://nant.sourceforge.net&#34;&gt;Nant&lt;/a&gt;* .  I was pretty happy, as it allow a decent way to compile my Java (and C#) without using make files.  Life was good as I could finally introduce some structure into HOW code was compiled.  The build process was no longer using whatever &#34;build&#34; command the IDE exposed, hoping that I didn&#39;t forget a compiler directive or a file or a reference to some other library along the way.  Other programmers could also compile the code with out fear as well.  Having a tool like Nant is pretty crucial to the whole concept of continuous integration.&#xA;&#xA;Somewhere along the way, though, Nant lost it&#39;s shine.  It isn&#39;t to hard to find these monster Nant scripts with all kinds of crazy things happening inside them.  Trying to work with these files can be a bit of a burden, to say the least.&#xA;&#xA;This takes me back to the title:  it seems to me that build tools like Nant have kind of peaked, functionally speaking.  What does that mean?  We can always add more tasks (created in a real programming language) to do things for us, but in a lot of ways Nant is constrained by the fact that it is just XML.  We can always add tasks to Nant, but somethings just can&#39;t be handled by out of the box, one size fits all tasks from Nant (or &lt;a href=&#34;http://nantcontrib.sourceforge.net&#34;&gt;NantContrib&lt;/a&gt;).  As soon as you run into those things, you need to start writing code.  XML is good for config files (to a point).  It&#39;s bad for programming logic.  It is not at all uncommon to see in build files if statements doing all kinds of things.  We don&#39;t need to (and should not) make XML into another programming language. &#xA;&#xA;I spent a bit of time tonight playing with &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/boo-build-system/&#34;&gt;Bake&lt;/a&gt;.  For those who don&#39;t know, &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/boo-build-system/&#34;&gt;Bake&lt;/a&gt; is to &lt;a href=&#34;http://boo.codehaus.org&#34;&gt;boo&lt;/a&gt; what &lt;a href=&#34;http://rake.rubyforge.org&#34;&gt;Rake&lt;/a&gt; is to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ruby-lang.org&#34;&gt;ruby&lt;/a&gt;.  Or, in other terms, think of a build system that is actually based on a programming language, and not a configuration file.  Why did I pick Bake?  Well, it&#39;s boo, and I want to learn boo.  Boo is .NET, so I can leverage what I already know.  Plus, I&#39;m reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ayende.com&#34;&gt;Ayende&#39;&lt;/a&gt;s book &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.manning.com/rahien/&#34;&gt;Building Domain Specific Languages in Boo&lt;/a&gt;, so Bake just seems to be a natural fit.&#xA;&#xA;So far, I&#39;m liking it.  In the span of a couple hours, I managed to figure out how to create a quick bake script (~ 40 lines of boo) to compile some code.  I&#39;d say that this script more readable (or soluble, to use the words of Scott Bellware) when compared to a Nant script.  Being pretty new, Bake doesn&#39;t have as many tasks as Nant.  However, it does seem pretty easy to create tasks for Bake.  Plus, I have all the expressiveness of a programming language available to me now&#xA;&#xA;I did have one glitch that is worth mentioning:  the task to compile my code was using the &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/boo-build-system/issues/detail?id=3&#34;&gt;CSC.EXE from .NET 2.0&lt;/a&gt;.  This is a problem when you&#39;re working with a .NET 3.5 codebase.  But, no fear, I hacked out a quick fix inside of about 15 minutes, and all is well again.&#xA;&#xA;I imagine that someone soon will blog about using Rake to build your .NET projects.  I eagerly await such a post.  In the meantime, I&#39;m going to continue on with Bake, and see if it will meet my needs.&#xA;&#xA;* &lt;em&gt;NOTE:  I lump MSBuild in with NAnt as MSBuild, IMHO, is a clone of NAnt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, April 24, at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.edmug.net&#34;&gt;Edmonton .NET User&#39;s Group&lt;/a&gt;, I did a presentation on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.castleproject.org/monorail/index.html&#34;&gt;MonoRail&lt;/a&gt; (and a bit on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.castleproject.org/container/index.html&#34;&gt;Windsor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.castleproject.org/activerecord/index.html&#34;&gt;ActiveRecord&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;#160; Thanks to all for coming out hear me talk.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I found it to be a pretty hard topic to cover in not quite 120 minutes.&amp;#160; There is just so much to cover and explain.&amp;#160; As well, it seemed that there were a couple in the crowd that felt a bit overloaded.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/&#34;&gt;Jeremy Miller&lt;/a&gt; talking about the trials and tribulations of keeping a &lt;a href=&#34;http://structuremap.sourceforge.net/Default.htm&#34;&gt;codebase&lt;/a&gt; viable and useful over the past four years.&amp;#160; A lot of tips and explanations were backed with diagrams on the whiteboard.&amp;#160; Kind of hard to blog that stuff, so this will probably be just a collection of bullets.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lessons learned - a lot of them relate back to what are considered good, OO practices:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don&#39;t_repeat_yourself&#34;&gt;DRY&lt;/a&gt;, especially with the very small things.&amp;#160; When Jeremy was adding support for .NET 2.0, the generic support was problematic.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; &lt;br /&gt;Example:&amp;#160; Want to resolve a Repository&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;.&amp;#160; You can&#39;t just look for the class Repository`1: i.e. was trying to resolve the class by using&amp;#160; typeof(Repository`1).&amp;#160; This did not work. &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TellDontAsk&#34;&gt;Tell, Don&#39;t Ask&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160; Didn&#39;t follow this to heavily at first, and so now effort has to be taken to rewrite code to adhere to this principle. &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Using a lot of Double Dispatch (&lt;em&gt;hah!&amp;#160; look Jeremy the picture did turn out&lt;/em&gt;):       &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.opgenorth.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/SSPX0289_2.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img style=&#34;border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px&#34; title=&#34;SSPX0289_2&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;SSPX0289_2&#34; src=&#34;http://www.opgenorth.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/SSPX0289_2_thumb.png&#34; width=&#34;244&#34; height=&#34;222&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;If you need to refactor, do it now.&amp;#160; Procrastination only makes it (refactoring) harder and more costly. &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;If you want to build a .NET framework and keep it around for four to five years, you should probably learn a bit about the fundamentals of .NET. &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Small steps, frequent commits to source code. &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Good solid battery of unit tests really helps with major changes. &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Moving more towards coarser grained tests.&amp;#160; Does the test check the functionality?&amp;#160; Not to worried about the intermediate steps.      &lt;ul&gt;       &lt;li&gt;Assertions based on side effects really don&#39;t work well.&amp;#160; Not very expressive, sometimes hard to figure out what what you&#39;re trying to test. &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;/ul&gt;   &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;It helps have tooling inside your tests in order to help you quickly create tests, especially the difficult to setup/create tests.&amp;#160; Will result in a faster feedback cycle.&amp;#160; This infrastructure is more strategic, can be very help. &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Jeremy recommends &amp;quot;Pragmatic Programmers&amp;quot; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Brief discussion about where to start learning all these pattern.&amp;#160; Advice is given to learn principles first (DRY, OCP, SRP, SOC, etc) as this will greatly help with the understanding and proper use of design patterns.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two topics merged into one.&amp;#160; Rod Paddock wants to talk about stored procs, and others want to learn how to explain NHibernate to other people who aren&#39;t familiar with it (and minimize the jargon).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Rod uses a custom code-gen solution based heavily on sprocs - a data driven approach.&amp;#160; Sounds like it works well for him.&amp;#160; Oren concurs that this technique could be very effective in certain circumstances.&amp;#160; It will have problems with complex situations that deal with convoluted/difficult data scenarios.&amp;#160; He&#39;s giving an example, but I just can&#39;t keep up with him.&amp;#160; The point of Oren&#39;s story is that a domain driven approach will would better when you&#39;re not dealing with data but with data and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Joe starts polling to see what people want to talk about.&amp;#160; Most seem to be interest the libraries for Mono (being that they also work on Windows/.NET.&amp;#160; So, Joe starts talking about libraries for/from Mono. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt;   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mono-project.com/Cecil&#34;&gt;Mono.Cecil&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160; For all your reflecting and assembly modification needs. &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mono-project.com/Mono.Addins&#34;&gt;Mono.Addins&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160; I&#39;ve been looking at this off and on today, and I have to admit it looks pretty intriguing &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mono-project.com/Rocks&#34;&gt;Mono.Rocks&lt;/a&gt;:&amp;#160; Handy extension methods. &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mono-project.com/Mono.Zeroconf&#34;&gt;Mono.Zeroconf&lt;/a&gt;: Zero configuration networking library &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ndesk.org/DBusSharp&#34;&gt;DBus#&lt;/a&gt;:&amp;#160; A C# implementation of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus&#34;&gt;D-Bus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mono-project.com/MonoCurses&#34;&gt;MonoCurses&lt;/a&gt;: An API for console based applications &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;GTK# vs Windows:      &lt;ul&gt;       &lt;li&gt;My suggestion is to consider the target environment.&amp;#160; If you targeting Windows, stick with WinForms.&amp;#160; If you&#39;re targetting Linux/Mac, go with GTK#.&amp;#160; &lt;/li&gt;        &lt;li&gt;Another issue that might influence your decision is that the documentation for GTK# is pretty sketchy, not very good. &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;/ul&gt;   &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mono-project.com/IOMap&#34;&gt;IOMap&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160; Turning this flag on, will help you with some of the cross-platform development issues.&amp;#160; This is a portable library that will help resolve things like directory seperators, case sensitivity in paths, and that sort of thing. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A short session, which isn&#39;t bad.&amp;#160; Gives me a chance to float around to check out some other things.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, this month &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.edmug.net&#34;&gt;EDMUG&lt;/a&gt; was hard up for speakers, so out of desperation they asked if I had anything to say.&amp;#160; I figured I could talk for about 30 minutes on MonoRail, and then read the newspaper out loud for the next 90 minutes.&amp;#160; Oddly, the EDMUG executive was okay with that.&amp;#160; This morning they sent out their notice to the membership:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday, April 24th&lt;/strong&gt; will not just be one of the greatest EDMUG evenings of all time, but it will also be the opportunity of a &lt;strong&gt;lifetime&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;#160; It will be your chance to rub shoulders with&lt;strong&gt; a legend that walks like a man&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;#160; And the name of that legend is:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my last post, I described how easy jQuery makes it to call an ASP.NET Web Service via AJAX.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Currently, I&#39;m developing on Windows XP (SP2), Resharper 4 (running inside Visual Studio 2008), and using the Visual Studio Web Server.&amp;#160; We deploy to Windows 2003 R2/IIS6.&amp;#160; When I pushed the code described in my last post to the development server to test it out there, the web service call kept failing with an HTTP Status of 500 (internal error).&amp;#160; This basically means something went wrong on the server.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Once again, appealling to the niche (non-existant?) market, I give you a quick run down on using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.db4o.com/&#34;&gt;db4o&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.castleproject.org/container/index.html&#34;&gt;Castle Windsor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.castleproject.org/index.php/Facility:db4o&#34;&gt;db4o facility&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160; Yes, I know the link for the db4o facility link doesn&#39;t work.&amp;#160; That is what prompted me to do this blog post. This is because, a while ago, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.db4o.com/&#34;&gt;db4o&lt;/a&gt; facility was pulled from the Castle Project.&amp;#160; Apparently there was a licencing concern.&amp;#160; It&#39;s my understanding that this has since been resolved, and I seen now that there is again the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.db4o.com&#34;&gt;db4o&lt;/a&gt; facility.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A nice feature is that you can use this reformat code to also organize and layout your code files the way you like it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href=&#34;http://codebetter.com/blogs/kyle.baley/archive/2007/12/17/removing-regions-or-quot-how-to-keep-your-code-expanded-quot.aspx&#34;&gt;Kyle Baley did post&lt;/a&gt; on how to how to use the format code to get rid of regions. His techique is a bit unrefined - his revolutionary, dogmatic zeal he will clobber all regions and do nothing else - but still handy.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Myself, I&#39;m a bit more compulsive / fussy when it comes to the layout of my code. Not only do I want regions gone, but I want the code to appear in a certain order. Lucky for me that Reformat Code does this for me. Here is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.opgenorth.net/Data/Sites/1/Files/ResharperPatterns.xml&#34;&gt;Type Member Layout pattern I use&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to use it, just paste it into the type member layout window in Resharper.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fun with Open Source: OpenDental</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The past week I&#39;ve been dabbling with an open source program called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.open-dent.com/&#34;&gt;Open Dental&lt;/a&gt; - mostly trying to see if can get it to compile under Mono, and running under Linux.&amp;#160; I figure that this would be a good opportunity to and work with a cross platform application. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;According to their website, Open Dental has been supported under Linux since v4.7.&amp;#160; Here are some notes of my efforts so far.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You will need Mono v1.2.5.&amp;#160; It seems that there is a problem with the Linux binary installer ( a known bug that will be corrected in 1.2.6).&amp;#160; I used the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mono-project.com/Downloads&#34;&gt;OpenSUSE 10.2 VMWare image&lt;/a&gt; which had a 1.2.5 install all set up.&amp;#160; That solved my problem of getting a current Linux distro with the most recent version of Mono.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Javascript Didnât Rape My Dog</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing I noticed since I started doing ASP.NET programming back in 2002: I started using Javascript a lot less, and my copy of JavaScript: The Definitive Guide sits on the shelf gathering dust.&amp;#160; I&#39;ve noticed a lot of developers I&#39;ve worked with are the same way. In fact, I&#39;d say that most of the ASP.NET programmers I&#39;ve worked with these days really don&#39;t know much about Javascript.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t blame Javascript itself for this - I blame ASP.NET. Developers just get used to dropping the server side controls on their WebForms, and then doing everything server side. I&#39;ve also worked at clients which had a &amp;quot;no client-side javascript&amp;quot; rule. All of this combines to cause our (my) Javascript skills to atrophy and wither. Kind of shame, really. (note: to a degree, I think the same can be said about CSS).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is Right About .NET?</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/archives/what-is-right-about-net/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, on one of the mailing lists I subscribe to, a member starting bashing .NET. A bit curious as to why there was this strong hatred of .NET, I posed a simple question:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is wrong with .NET?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The answer I got back somewhat suprised me:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I guess the standard reply is, what is right about .NET?&amp;#160; .NET was invented so that M$ could provide software as a service. You would end up with a minimal OS on the disk, and no applications. When you turned your computer on, it would download whatever applications you needed, or did so on demand; if your subscription was paid up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why I love &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nhibernate.org&#34;&gt;NHibernate&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I am rather please by the fact that a database schema change involving the creation of six new tables, three one-to-many relationships, and a many-to-many relationship (which includes a sort order on the join table) can be taken care of inside of seven easy hours.&amp;#160; It probably would/could have been less, but I crafted the HBM and class files by hand and had a few typos which hide themselves well.&amp;#160; This also included the time it took to create some quick integration tests to ensure that CRUD is working.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>NHibernate and Parent/Child Collections</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/archives/nhibernate-and-parentchild-collections/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On a project that I&#39;m currently involved with, I&#39;m using NHibernate and a persistance-ignorant domain. Today NHibernate threw me a &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;You may not dereference an collection with cascade=&amp;quot;all-delete-orphan&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; error. This kind of had me confused for a bit. What this error means is this: When you have a parent-child relation in your domain, say something like this:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;pre&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0em; width: 100%; font-family: consolas,&amp;#39;Courier New&amp;#39;,courier,monospace; font-size: 12px&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #0000ff&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #0000ff&#34;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; Parent&#xA;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0em; width: 100%; font-family: consolas,&amp;#39;Courier New&amp;#39;,courier,monospace; font-size: 12px&#34;&gt;{&#xA;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0em; width: 100%; font-family: consolas,&amp;#39;Courier New&amp;#39;,courier,monospace; font-size: 12px&#34;&gt;     ISet&amp;lt;Child&amp;gt; _children;&#xA;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0em; width: 100%; font-family: consolas,&amp;#39;Courier New&amp;#39;,courier,monospace; font-size: 12px&#34;&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can&#39;t do something like this in the parent class:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Unit Testing Data Access</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing that I don&#39;t like about writing tests is some of the jiggery-pokery that goes on with testing database access code. Jiggery-pokery being: ensuring the tables are there, up to date, and are holding the data that they are supposed to hold before and after the test has run. If you don&#39;t pay attention to these details, you get a lot of false negatives on your unit tests. This will result in a loss of confidence in your unit tests. When this happens you stop running them, and loose confidence in your ability to refactor without fear.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I was house-bound looking after a sick eight year old boy.&amp;#160; To help pass time, I decided to play around with my chronograph (to clarify: in this context a chronograph is a tool to help you measure the velocity of projecticles, i.e. bullets).&amp;#160; I happen to own a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shootingchrony.com/&#34;&gt;Shooting Chrony&lt;/a&gt; Beta Master, which you can, in theory, hook up via a serial port to your computer, download the velocities of up to 60 shots, and use that data to help you with building up some ballisitic tables for your firearm and hand-loaded ammunition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So last night I installed Visual Studio 2008 RTM on my laptop.&amp;#160; This was a clean install - I did not have any beta versions of VS2008 installed.&amp;#160; When I went to try and do anything in VS2008, I kept getting the message &#39;Visual Studio has encountered an unexpected error.&amp;quot;.&amp;#160; This error happens when I try to do anything, including VS2008.&amp;#160; The only way to close VS2008 was using Task Manager.&amp;#160; Most annoying.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(or, &lt;em&gt;DataRowView How I Hate Thee&lt;/em&gt;)     &lt;br /&gt;Recently I had to enhance an ASP.NET 2.0 &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ui.webcontrols.gridview.aspx&#34;&gt;GridView&lt;/a&gt; on a Web Form.&amp;#160; Basically, the idea is that, if a certain field in the grid was false, I would strike-through all the text in that row.&amp;#160; It seems simple enough: just use the &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ui.webcontrols.gridview.rowdatabound.aspx&#34;&gt;RowDataBound&lt;/a&gt; event of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ui.webcontrols.gridview.aspx&#34;&gt;GridView&lt;/a&gt; control and&amp;#160; apply the formating.&amp;#160; Wanting to make this as testable as possible, I thought that perhaps some sort of decorator class would do the trick, something like: &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Not So Deep Thoughts on Stored Procedures</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/archives/not-so-deep-thoughts-on-stored-procedures/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that stored procedures are more of a specialist&#39;s tool than a generalist.&amp;#160; To me, stored procedures are the kind of thing you use when you need to optimize your data access, or you have to do something DB specific.&amp;#160; Sure, I&#39;ve seen lots (and written lots) of stored procedures to do the basic CRUD (mostly in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/sql&#34;&gt;SQL Server&lt;/a&gt;, but also in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.postgresql.org&#34;&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt;). These days though, I almost think that one doesn&#39;t need stored procedures for the basic CRUD, only for specific and special cases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/archives/embedded-database-and-net/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in some of my previous blog entries, I&#39;m looking for am embedded database.&amp;#160; At the present, I think that I will remove SQL Server CE for now.&amp;#160; The biggest reason is that, as part of my pet project, the application to run on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page&#34;&gt;Mono&lt;/a&gt; as well.&amp;#160; So, that kind of leaves &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sqlite.org/&#34;&gt;SQLite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.firebirdsql.org&#34;&gt;Firebird&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160; &lt;br /&gt;Now, in theory, it should matter much between the two for what I want to do.&amp;#160; I&#39;m planning to use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.castleproject.org/activerecord/index.html&#34;&gt;ActiveRecord&lt;/a&gt; for my data layer, and I see that both &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sqlite.org/&#34;&gt;SQLite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.firebirdsql.org&#34;&gt;Firebird&lt;/a&gt; are supported.&amp;#160; So, switching between &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sqlite.org/&#34;&gt;SQLite&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.firebirdsql.org&#34;&gt;Firebird&lt;/a&gt; will be pretty minimal.&amp;#160; What about stored procedures, I hear you say?&amp;#160; Well, truth be told, in my old age, I&#39;ve sort of drifted away from stored procedures and look at them with a suspicious eye.&amp;#160; So, the fact that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sqlite.org/&#34;&gt;SQLite&lt;/a&gt; doesn&#39;t have stored procedures really doesn&#39;t bother or impact me at all.    &lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ll do a bit more comparison between the two, and then decided from there which database to use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, as predicted something did distract me from my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.castleproject.org/index.php/ActiveRecord&#34;&gt;ActiveRecord&lt;/a&gt; experiment.&amp;#160; I got a copy of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.genom-e.com&#34;&gt;Genome Express&lt;/a&gt; while at an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.edmug.net/&#34;&gt;EDMUG&lt;/a&gt; meeting recently.&amp;#160; Given that my copy of Genome Express was shiny and new, I installed it and began playing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My initialize impression is that it&#39;s promising.&amp;#160; I was able to very quickly reverse engineer a SQL 2005 schema and get a heirarchical data model going.&amp;#160; I was able to generate working DAL code for a 12 table database inside of a couple of hours.&amp;#160; About 75% of this time was spent reading the documentation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately I&#39;ve been playing with MSBuild, the new build tool that ships with Visual Studio 2005.&amp;#160; Before, I&#39;ve always used &lt;a href=&#34;http://nant.sourceforge.net&#34;&gt;Nant&lt;/a&gt; for my automated builds.&amp;#160; I&#39;ve been using nant since 2002 or so, and found it to be a pretty useful, stable tool to take the drudgery out of deploying builds.&amp;#160; Figured I would give MSBuild a try, just for comparison sake.&amp;#160; &lt;br /&gt;I must say, MSBuild isn&#39;t bad.&amp;#160; One thing that I&#39;ve found interesting about is that it has been ridiculously easy to port tasks from &lt;a href=&#34;http://nant.sourceforge.net&#34;&gt;nant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://nantcontrib.sourceforge.net&#34;&gt;nantcontrib&lt;/a&gt; to MSBuild.&amp;#160; So far I&#39;ve written tasks to apply a label to VSS, and to help me create a zip file holding the deployables of the build. &lt;/p&gt;</description>
