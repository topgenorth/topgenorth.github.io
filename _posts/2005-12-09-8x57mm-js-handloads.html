<p>Tried out some handloads for my Mauser 98K.&#160; It definately seems that it does not like 170gr Hornady RN bullets.&#160; I've tried all sorts of loads with this bullet, and the groups always seem to be ~ 4 or 5 MOA.&#160; It really does seem to like the 200 Sierra MatchKing and and 220gr Sierra GameKings.</p>
