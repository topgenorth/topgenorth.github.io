<p>Pardon the dust as we move things around.&#160; I'm currently transitioning from <a title="MojoPortal" href="http://www.mojoportal.com">MojoPortal</a> to WordPress.&#160; It will probably be a painful process.&#160; Drink scotch.&#160; It helps.</p>  <p><em>Update</em>:&#160; Slowly adding some of my older posts as I find them, and have the time and inclination.&#160; Thankfully Windows Live Writer keeps a copy of old posts, which makes getting some of the more recent content easier.</p>
