Just a heads up that <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/canada/techdays/default.aspx">TechDays Canada 2009</a> is happening in Calgary next week on November 17 and 18.  Yours truly will be there for the whole morning of November 18th talking about ASP.NET MVC and SOLID (note that this is <strong>not</strong> the same SOLID talk from the DevFundamentals track at TechDays Vancouver and TechDays Toronto).  If you happen to be there, don't be afraid to come on by and say hello.
