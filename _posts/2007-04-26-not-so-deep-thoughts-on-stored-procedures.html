<p>Lately I've come to the conclusion that stored procedures are more of a specialist's tool than a generalist.&#160; To me, stored procedures are the kind of thing you use when you need to optimize your data access, or you have to do something DB specific.&#160; Sure, I've seen lots (and written lots) of stored procedures to do the basic CRUD (mostly in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql">SQL Server</a>, but also in <a href="http://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a>). These days though, I almost think that one doesn't need stored procedures for the basic CRUD, only for specific and special cases.</p>  <p><em>Right Tool for the Right Job</em>    <br />My logic for this is pretty simple: OR/M tools are pretty good these days.&#160; I'm going to single out <a href="http://www.nhibernate.org">NHibernate</a> in this case, as that is what I've got the most familiarization with.&#160; They way I see it, <a href="http://www.nhibernate.org">NHibernate</a> will do as good a job with the basic CRUD stuff as I will rolling my own stored procedures.&#160; Factor in a code generation tool like <a href="http://www.mygenerationsoftware.com">MyGeneration</a>, and you're getting a DAL out the door pretty fast.</p>  <p><em>Separation of Concerns</em>    <br />With the CRUD neatly rolled up into an <a href="http://www.nhibernate.org">NHibernate </a>DAL, one can then keep business logic where it belongs:&#160; in code (specifically a business tier) and not in the database.&#160; One of the pitfalls with stored procedures is that sometimes business logic leaks into them.&#160; If you ask me, business logic doesn't belong in your database.</p>  <p><em>Maintainability</em>    <br />Need to debug a stored procedure?&#160; That usually isn't as fun or as easy as debugging code.&#160; This is doubly so if you've got a good battery of unit tests to back your code.&#160; Many times I've run into a situation when a change to a stored procedure requires re-compiling the application and updating the database.&#160; I find that it's nice when you can remove one of those steps.</p> <em></em>  <p><em>Specialization</em>    <br />As a consultant, over the past few year, I've had to work with a variety of RDBMS's:&#160; <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">SQL Server</a>, <a href="http://www.oracle.com">Oracle</a>, <a href="http://www.mysql.com">MySQL</a>, <a href="http://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a>, and Microsoft Access (Jet) to name a few.&#160; Each of those, if they do happen to have facilities for stored procedures, has their own way of doing so.&#160; A tool like <a href="http://www.nhibernate.org">NHibernate</a> relieves me from learning the intricacies of all these databases.&#160; I can send my time concentrating on things like architecture, business rules, and user interface knowing that <a href="http://www.nhibernate.org">NHibernate</a> has my back for my DAL.&#160; </p>  <p>I'd be curious to hear what others think.</p>
