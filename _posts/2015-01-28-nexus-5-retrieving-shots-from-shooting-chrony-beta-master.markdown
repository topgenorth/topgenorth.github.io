I spent a little bit of time since Christmas working on an Android application that will download velocities from my Shooting Chrony Beta Master. First I pair my Android phone to my Shooting Chrony [via bluetooth](http://www.opgenorth.net/blog/2015/01/21/adding-bluetooth-to-your-shooting-chrony/). A couple of taps on the screen, and lo, shot data is retrieved:

The app itself isn't ready for public consumption, but as a proof of concept it is encouraging to see. I uploaded a [video of this to YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f86lG9KTMf8) so you can see the application in action.

The next "big feature" will be to somehow download the shot data from the phone &ndash; maybe by e-mailing it or uploading a CSV to Google Drive or Dropbox.
