<p>After a bit of tinkering, I managed to provision my ADP1 setup without a SIM card.&#160; A bit of google, and here is what I did</p>  <ol>   <li>Download the Android SDK.&#160; In my case, I unzipped it to C:\android-sdk-windows-1.1_r1. </li>    <li>Connection the phone via the USB cable to my computer.&#160; When the phone asks for a device. </li>    <li>You’ll get the new hardware dialog, when prompted for the drivers, you’ll need to specify the location.&#160; The Android SDK has the drivers, in my case they were at C:\android-sdk-windows-1.1_r1\usb_driver\x86. </li>    <li>Once you have the drivers installed cd to c:\android-sdk-windows-1.1_r1\tools. </li>    <li>Type adb devices.&#160; This should list all the Android devices that you have connected.&#160; If you don’t see any devices listed, then you have a problem. </li>    <li>Type adb shell.&#160; This will direct your commands to your ADP1 </li>    <li>Now while at the adb shell, su to root, then :&#160; </li>    <li>cd /data/data/com.android/providers.settings/databases/ </li>    <li>sqlite3 settings.db </li>    <li>INSERT INTO system (name, value) VALUES (‘device_provisioned’, 1); </li>    <li>.quit </li>    <li>Reboot the phone </li>    <li>adb shell </li>    <li>am start –a android.intent.action.MAIN –n com.android.settings/.Settings </li> </ol>  <p>Once all that is done, you should be enable to use your ADP1 as if you had a SIM card in it (we’ll except for the phoning part).</p>  <p>Useful link:&#160; <a href="http://www.gotontheinter.net/content/faq-unlockingactivating-g1-or-adp1-without-sim-card">FAQ: Unlocking/Activating a G1 or ADP1 Without A Sim Card</a>.</p>
