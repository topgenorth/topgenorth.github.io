<p>As it has been slow lately, I thought I would take a minute to say &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; to <a href="http://www.igloocoder.com/">Don Belcham, aka the Igloo Coder</a>.</p>  <p>Don, for those of you who don't know, is potentate of the <a href="http://www.edmug.net/">Edmonton .NET User Group</a>:     <br /><a href="http://www.opgenorth.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/DonBelcham_EDMUG_Prez.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="DonBelcham_EDMUG_Prez" border="0" alt="DonBelcham_EDMUG_Prez" src="http://www.opgenorth.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/DonBelcham_EDMUG_Prez_thumb.png" width="244" height="164" /></a> </p>  <p>He's acquired some fame, mostly for his ability to consume large amounts of single malt whisky before public speaking. <a href="http://graysmatter.codivation.com/HappyBirthdayDonaldBelcham.aspx">Inspired by Justice Gray</a>, here is a little story<sup>*</sup> I'd like to share about Don.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.opgenorth.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/peyote.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; margin-left: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="peyote" border="0" alt="peyote" align="left" src="http://www.opgenorth.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/peyote_thumb.jpg" width="128" height="105" /></a> In the fall of 2007, Don &amp; I decided to attend<a href="http://desertcodecamp.com/"> Desert Code Camp 3</a> as presenters. I went down with the wholesome and altruistic intentions to speak about Mono, and Test Driven Development. Don wanted peyote. Don didn't know that peyote doesn't grow (naturally) in Arizona.</p>  <p>Needles to say, this didn't make Don happy. It was very grumpy Don who went to the session on &quot;Intelligent Singletons/Factories using Dependency Injection in ObjectBuilder / Composite UI Application Block&quot;. I went to watch. Don proceeded to get liqoured up and throw empty whisky bottles whenever &quot;intelligent singleton&quot; was mentioned. I guess the moral of the story is that Don is a grumpy drunk when he doesn't get his peyote.</p>  <p>Anyway, happy birthday Don. You don't look a day over 48.</p>
