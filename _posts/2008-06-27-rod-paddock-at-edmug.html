<p>Last night (Thursday, June 26th) <a href="http://blog.dashpoint.com/">Rod Paddock</a> gave a talk on using <a href="http://www.silverlight.net">Silverlight</a> 2.0 to the Edmonton .NET User Group.&#160; I'd say that Rod did a pretty good job, despite the fact that the beta of both <a href="http://www.silverlight.net">Silverlight</a> and Expression Blend didn't exactly want to play nice all the time.&#160; It's definitely perked my interest in the technology, and I can see a lot of business potential for it. </p>  <p>The rich user experience that <a href="http://www.silverlight.net">Silverlight</a> brings to the web-browser, will, I think raise the bar for what web applications will do for businesses.&#160; Forget all the buzz about ASP.NET MVC or MonoRail or ASP.NET 3.5.&#160; This is just another layer of makeup on the tired, old, hooker that is application development in .NET.&#160; <a href="http://www.silverlight.net">Silverlight</a> is what will make business users oh and ah and get excited about web apps again.</p>  <p>Those who were at last night's talk will remember that Rod was using a fairly large database that he got from <a href="http://www.freedb.org/">freedb</a>.&#160; It's fairly large, not quite 7GB of data.&#160; I did get a copy of it, in MS-SQL Server format.&#160; When I compressed it (tar.gz), I got it down to 2GB in size.&#160; If you're interested in a copy of the database for your own purposes, leave me a comment here and we'll work something out. </p>  <p>Note:&#160; I would like to state that <a href="http://www.igloocoder.com">Don</a> is usually drunk, and as such you shouldn't believe some of the wild things he said last night, especially about me.</p>
