<p>Today is the 64th anniversary of D-Day.&#160; If you are a Canadian, take a moment today and read up about 3rd Canadian Infantry Division and the 14, 000 Canadians which went ashore at Juno Beach (the 2nd most heavily defended beach of the invasion). </p>  <p>Likewise, if you're British, I would suggest taking a moment today and reading up on Sword and Gold beach. </p>  <p>And, if you are American, then perhaps read up on Utah and Omaha beach (the most heavily defended beach of the whole invasion).&#160; And no, watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120815/">Saving Private Ryan</a> doesn't count.</p>  <p>Granted military history (which I read a lot of) can be kind of boring and slow sometimes, but D-Day was a very important day in the 20th century, and some of the troops involved had been training for almost a year for just this one day.</p>
