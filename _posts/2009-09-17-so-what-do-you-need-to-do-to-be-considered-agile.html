<p>One question that has been bouncing around in my mind is what, exactly, does one have to do to be considered Agile?&#160; Let’s look at the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools      <br />Working software over comprehensive documentation       <br />Customer collaboration over contract negotiation       <br />Responding to change over following a plan</p>    <p>That is, while there is value in the items on      <br />the right, we value the items on the left more. </p> </blockquote>  <p>Sounds pretty simple.&#160; I notice that there are twelve <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">Agile principles</a>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer      <br />through early and continuous delivery       <br />of valuable software. </p>    <p>Welcome changing requirements, even late in      <br />development. Agile processes harness change for       <br />the customer's competitive advantage. </p>    <p>Deliver working software frequently, from a      <br />couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a       <br />preference to the shorter timescale. </p>    <p>Business people and developers must work      <br />together daily throughout the project. </p>    <p>Build projects around motivated individuals.      <br />Give them the environment and support they need,       <br />and trust them to get the job done. </p>    <p>The most efficient and effective method of      <br />conveying information to and within a development       <br />team is face-to-face conversation. </p>    <p>Working software is the primary measure of progress. </p>    <p>Agile processes promote sustainable development.      <br />The sponsors, developers, and users should be able       <br />to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. </p>    <p>Continuous attention to technical excellence      <br />and good design enhances agility. </p>    <p>Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount      <br />of work not done--is essential. </p>    <p>The best architectures, requirements, and designs      <br />emerge from self-organizing teams. </p>    <p>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how      <br />to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts       <br />its behaviour accordingly. </p> </blockquote>  <p>The agile principles are interesting, because in a lot of ways I can see advocates of other methodologies (BDUF) saying the believe in the same thing.</p>  <p>Asking amongst some peers, and there didn’t really seem to be a concise definition of Agile and what you need to do to call yourself.&#160; I’ve seen some places that will suggest that they are Agile because they stand up at meetings (or a manager wanders around once a day), avoid documentation, and have a meeting every three or four weeks that they call a “retrospective”.&#160; So, does anybody care to offer up their thoughts on what one needs to do to be considered Agile?&#160; I have my own thoughts, but figured I’d save them for a later blog post.</p>
