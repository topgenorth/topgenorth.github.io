Thinking it might be time to change things up around here, namely moving off of <a href="http://www.mojoportal.com">MojoPortal</a> and on to something else (probably <a href="http://www.wordpress.com">WordPress</a>).  This largely stems from my desire to simplify things to free up time to pursue other interests.  I got started in MojoPortal about 5 years ago when I wanted to learn more about <a href="http://www.go-mono.com">Mono</a>, and figure that the best way to that was to use it.

These days I find myself wandering over to the <a href="http://dev.android.com/index.html">Android</a> stack and am dipping my toe into Ruby/<a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> as well, so the whole point to using MojoPortal, for me, isn’t as relevant anymore.  WordPress seems pretty capable and looks like it has Windows Live Writer support, so seems like a logical choice for me.

I’m hoping that I will be able to export my blog content from MojoPortal and over to WordPress, and hopefully set up some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_301">301 redirects</a> to manage things, but I’m not 100% sure I’ll have the time and inclination to pull that off.

When will I do this?  Not sure, but I’m thinking by the end of September 2009.
