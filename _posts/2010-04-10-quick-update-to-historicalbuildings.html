I just <a href="http://www.opgenorth.net/misc/HistoricalBuildings.apk">uploaded an update</a> to <a href="http://github.com/topgenorth/historicalbuildings">HistoricalBuildings</a>.&nbsp; The list of historical buildings used to be sorted alphabetically, by name.&nbsp; Now they are sorted by the distance from your current location (assuming the GPS can figure that out).<br /><br /><div class="zemanta-pixie"><img class="zemanta-pixie-img" alt="" src="http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=fd558971-287a-8b68-8a02-ced06dd1630f" /></div>
