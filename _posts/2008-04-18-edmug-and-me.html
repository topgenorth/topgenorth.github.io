<p>Well, this month <a href="http://www.edmug.net">EDMUG</a> was hard up for speakers, so out of desperation they asked if I had anything to say.&#160; I figured I could talk for about 30 minutes on MonoRail, and then read the newspaper out loud for the next 90 minutes.&#160; Oddly, the EDMUG executive was okay with that.&#160; This morning they sent out their notice to the membership:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>Thursday, April 24th</strong> will not just be one of the greatest EDMUG evenings of all time, but it will also be the opportunity of a <strong>lifetime</strong>.&#160; It will be your chance to rub shoulders with<strong> a legend that walks like a man</strong>.&#160; And the name of that legend is:</p>    <p><strong>Tom Opgenorth!!&#160; </strong></p>    <p>Yes, as unbelievable as it sounds, pick your jaws up off the floor because Edmonton's newest Microsoft MVP is coming to chat with EDMUG about <strong>Monorail</strong>!&#160; The man with the largest collections of Hawaiian shirts, functioning rifles, and spandex LuluLemon tops in the entire province will be here next Thursday for the presentation <strong>NO ONE</strong> dares to miss!&#160; As per usual, the presentation will be at the Edmonton Public Library; doors are open at 5:30 and the presentation will start at 6 PM.&#160; Be there or be <strong>riddled with gunfire*</strong>!       <br /><strong>ABSTRACT:        <br /></strong>      <br />Viewstate, PostBack, and Page LifeCycle! Oh My!</p>    <p>Interested in seeing another way to <a href="http://asp.net/">ASP.NET</a> applications without using       <br />Web Forms?&#160; Come to the April meeting of EDMUG and experience Monorail       <br />from the Castle Project.&#160; What is this Monorail we speak of?&#160; Monorail       <br />is a mature, stable, open source MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework       <br />for <a href="http://asp.net/">ASP.NET</a> from the Castle Project.&#160; Come learn about web       <br />applications without the Web Forms.       <br /><strong>BIO:        <br /></strong>Tom Opgenorth is a local .NET aficionado and consultant who has a       <br />tendency to dabble in Linux.&#160; He was recently received a Microsoft MVP       <br />Award for 2008 in C#.</p>    <p>* For the skittish, gunfire will not actually occur if you miss the presentation, but we highly recommend you attend</p> </blockquote>  <p>Really, I think that there should be two things banned:&#160; One is Justice and writing, the other is D'Arcy and Paint.NET.</p>
