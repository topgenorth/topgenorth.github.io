<p>Life has been a bit busy as of late.&#160; On Sept 4, 2010 a little monster invaded my house.&#160; A savage beast, suitably evolved for our Canadian winters and a fearless hunter of snow-snakes.&#160; Oh, that, and it turns out that she is a distant cousin to my last dog Bailey.&#160; This is my new puppy Casey, who is just shy of 9 weeks old.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.opgenorth.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9050049.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px" title="P9050049" border="0" alt="P9050049" src="http://www.opgenorth.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9050049_thumb.jpg" width="436" height="328" /></a></p>
