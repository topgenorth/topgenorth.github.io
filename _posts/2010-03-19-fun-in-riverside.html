<p>Just sitting here at <a href="http://www.legoland.com/">Legoland</a> in Carlsbad, CA waiting for my kids to get off Coastersaurus. Just thought I'd make a mention about my presentation on SOLID to the <a href="http://iedotnetug.org">Inland Empire .NET User</a> Group. This is my third year in a row as their March speaker. I'm glad to say that for the third year in a row they haven't chased me away with pitch-forks and torches. Largely based on that reason, I'll say the presentation went well. Well, that and the fact that the concepts did seem to be understood and there were no technical glitches.</p>  <p>Thanks James and his crew for agreeing to shift from the 2nd Tuesday to the 3rd Tuesday to accommodate my travel. </p>  <p>Here is a zip of the <a href="http://www.opgenorth.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/InlandEmpire.zip">code and slide deck</a>.</p>
