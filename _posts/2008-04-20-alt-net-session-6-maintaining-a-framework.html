<p><a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/">Jeremy Miller</a> talking about the trials and tribulations of keeping a <a href="http://structuremap.sourceforge.net/Default.htm">codebase</a> viable and useful over the past four years.&#160; A lot of tips and explanations were backed with diagrams on the whiteboard.&#160; Kind of hard to blog that stuff, so this will probably be just a collection of bullets.</p>  <p>Lessons learned - a lot of them relate back to what are considered good, OO practices:</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>, especially with the very small things.&#160; When Jeremy was adding support for .NET 2.0, the generic support was problematic.&#160;&#160; <br />Example:&#160; Want to resolve a Repository&lt;T&gt;.&#160; You can't just look for the class Repository`1: i.e. was trying to resolve the class by using&#160; typeof(Repository`1).&#160; This did not work. </li>    <li><a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TellDontAsk">Tell, Don't Ask</a>.&#160; Didn't follow this to heavily at first, and so now effort has to be taken to rewrite code to adhere to this principle. </li>    <li>Using a lot of Double Dispatch (<em>hah!&#160; look Jeremy the picture did turn out</em>):       <br /><a href="http://www.opgenorth.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/SSPX0289_2.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="SSPX0289_2" border="0" alt="SSPX0289_2" src="http://www.opgenorth.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/SSPX0289_2_thumb.png" width="244" height="222" /></a> </li>    <li>If you need to refactor, do it now.&#160; Procrastination only makes it (refactoring) harder and more costly. </li>    <li>If you want to build a .NET framework and keep it around for four to five years, you should probably learn a bit about the fundamentals of .NET. </li>    <li>Small steps, frequent commits to source code. </li>    <li>Good solid battery of unit tests really helps with major changes. </li>    <li>Moving more towards coarser grained tests.&#160; Does the test check the functionality?&#160; Not to worried about the intermediate steps.      <ul>       <li>Assertions based on side effects really don't work well.&#160; Not very expressive, sometimes hard to figure out what what you're trying to test. </li>     </ul>   </li>    <li>It helps have tooling inside your tests in order to help you quickly create tests, especially the difficult to setup/create tests.&#160; Will result in a faster feedback cycle.&#160; This infrastructure is more strategic, can be very help. </li>    <li>Jeremy recommends &quot;Pragmatic Programmers&quot; </li> </ul>  <p>Brief discussion about where to start learning all these pattern.&#160; Advice is given to learn principles first (DRY, OCP, SRP, SOC, etc) as this will greatly help with the understanding and proper use of design patterns.</p>
