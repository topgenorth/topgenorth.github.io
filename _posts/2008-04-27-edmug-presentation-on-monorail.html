<p>On Thursday, April 24, at the <a href="http://www.edmug.net">Edmonton .NET User's Group</a>, I did a presentation on <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/monorail/index.html">MonoRail</a> (and a bit on <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/container/index.html">Windsor</a> and <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/activerecord/index.html">ActiveRecord</a>).&#160; Thanks to all for coming out hear me talk.</p>  <p>I found it to be a pretty hard topic to cover in not quite 120 minutes.&#160; There is just so much to cover and explain.&#160; As well, it seemed that there were a couple in the crowd that felt a bit overloaded.</p>  <p>Congratulations to Carlos for finding the spot in my sample code where &lt;technobabble&gt;dependency injection could be use to create a less-tightly coupled controller&lt;/technobabble&gt;.&#160; I was going to give him the Reshaper license for finding it, but he had already has one and so declined.&#160; It was eventually raffled off at the end of the presentation.</p>  <p>For those who wanted the code and slide deck, <a href="http://localhost/Data/Sites/1/Files/EDMUG_MonoRail_20080424.zip">here they are</a>.</p>  <p>Someone else asked for a sample <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/monorail/index.html">MonoRail</a> application that they could look to help them learn MR.&#160; Here are a couple</p>  <ol>   <li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/altnetconf/">altnetconf</a> on googlecode.&#160; This is the code for the website of the first altnetconf held in Austin, TX in October of 2007 </li>    <li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/gearblog/">Gearblog</a>:&#160; a blog build on MonoRail </li>    <li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/mr-blogengine/">mr-blogengine</a>:&#160; Another blog build on MonoRail.&#160; This code is part of a <a href="http://benl.wordpress.com/2008/03/27/incremental-development-with-monorail/">series of blog posts</a> about incremental development in MonoRail. </li> </ol>
