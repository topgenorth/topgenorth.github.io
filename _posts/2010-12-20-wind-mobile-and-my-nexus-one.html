<p>Just recently I switch my mobile carrier from Rogers to <a title="WIND mobile" href="../../www.windmobile.ca">WIND Mobile</a>. Their <a title="Holiday Miracle Plan" href="http://www2.windmobile.ca/en/Pages/unlimitedtalktextdata.aspx">Holiday Miracle plan</a> was just to good to pass up - even paying the penalty to break my Rogers contract I will still save money in the long run.

Anyway, once the number got transferred over, I didn't have a 3G connection, even after selecting the WIND Home APN. &nbsp;After a bit of google, it seems that what I had to do is to setup an APN. &nbsp;In case I can't find it later, here are the APN settings:</p><table><tbody><tr><td>APN</td><td>mms.WINDmobile.ca</td></tr><tr><td>Proxy</td><td>&lt;Not Set&gt;</td></tr><tr><td>Port</td><td>&lt;Not Set&gt;</td></tr><tr><td>Username</td><td>&lt;Not Set&gt;</td></tr><tr><td>Password</td><td>&lt;Not Set&gt;</td></tr><tr><td>Server</td><td>&lt;Not Set&gt;</td></tr><tr><td>MMSC</td><td>http://mms.WINDmobile.ca</td></tr><tr><td>MMS proxy</td><td>74.115.197.70</td></tr><tr><td>MMS port</td><td>8080</td></tr><tr><td>MMC</td><td>302</td></tr><tr><td>MNC</td><td>490</td></tr><tr><td>Authentication type</td><td>&lt;Not set&gt;</td></tr><tr><td>APN type</td><td>mms</td></tr></tbody></table><p>After setting this up, bingo, got my 3G connection going.</p>
