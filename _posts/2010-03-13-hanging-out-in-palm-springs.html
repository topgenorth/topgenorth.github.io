<p>Given that I haven’t blogged while I was at home, I figured that I should be obtuse and do so while on vacation.&#160; Currently hanging out in sunny Palm Springs, California for a few days.&#160; On Tuesday, March 16th, I’ll be making my way down to the <a href="http://www.iedotnetug.org/sf/Index.aspx">Inland Empire .NET User Group</a> for a quick talk about SOLID.&#160; Then it’s off to Legoland and the San Diego Zoo.&#160; Oh, and somewhere in there I have to work in a trip to the <a href="http://www.palmspringsairmuseum.org/">Palm Springs Air Museum</a>.&#160; As a history buff, it’s really cool to see all the WW2 aircraft they have there – some of which are still in working order.</p>
