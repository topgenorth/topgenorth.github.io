Seems that there is a bit of a mess-up / problem / issue with the company that was hosting my blog. So, finally took the plunge and decided to migrate from Wordpress to Octopress.  I must say that the whole process was pretty painless. The whole process took about an hour and I was setup on heroku.com. Now I guess I get to play with Octpress.
