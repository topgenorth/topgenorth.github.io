<p>I guess I forgot to mention this:&#160; On April 1, 2010, I received an e-mail from Microsoft that my <a href="https://mvp.support.microsoft.com/profile=31F1E181-79EC-4497-B792-FA8F83D34936">MVP in C#</a> was renewed for the third year.&#160; This makes me a happy, because with Resharper 5 (and therefore Visual Studio 2010) and Windows Mobile 7, I’m hoping that this will be an exciting year for the .NET crowd.&#160; </p>  <p>Well, okay, perhaps I didn’t forget.&#160; Given that it was April 1st when I got the e-mail, I like to give things a few days to settle down.&#160; I am acquainted with some mischievous pranksters who would think it was a funny April Fools joke.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.opgenorth.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/MVP_Horizontal_FullColor.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px" title="MVP_Horizontal_FullColor" border="0" alt="MVP_Horizontal_FullColor" src="http://www.opgenorth.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/MVP_Horizontal_FullColor_thumb.png" width="240" height="97" /></a></p>
