For the past few years what little of done with this blog has been via Octopress 2.0. I though that Octopress would be a good choice for a lazy guy like me. The problem that I didn't expect was that maintaining/updating Octopress would be a real PITA. That, and who knew that Octpress would languish for several years. 

Now, I know that Octopress 3.0 available, but I figured that for the effort involved I'd be better off just falling back to Jekyll.

Things may be a bit ugly until I get around to prettying stuff up, but for now keeping things simple is probably best (for me anyway).
