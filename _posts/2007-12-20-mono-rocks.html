<p>For those getting into .NET 3.5, you might find <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Rocks">Mono.Rocks</a> of interest.&#160; I first saw this on <a href="http://evain.net/blog/articles/2007/11/13/mono-rocks">Jean-Baptiste Evain blog</a>.&#160; Basically, this is a collection of extension methods for the class libraries.&#160; They are covered under the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php">MIT licence</a>, so you can pretty much use it anywhere.</p>
