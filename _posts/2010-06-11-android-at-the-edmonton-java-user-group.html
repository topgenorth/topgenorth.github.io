<p>Just a heads up for those interested:&#160; On Tuesday, June 15th the Edmonton Java User’s Group is having it’s monthly meeting at noon at the Canadian Western Bank Building.&#160; The speaker is none other than yours truly.&#160; I’ll be giving a brief introduction to application development to Android, using my trusty G1 and IntelliJ.</p>  <p>It’s free to attend, so stop by if you’re so inclined.</p>
