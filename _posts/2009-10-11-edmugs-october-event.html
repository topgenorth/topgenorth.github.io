<p>Well, don’t let the name of the post fool you – the next <a href="http://www.edmug.net">EDMUG</a> event is in November, not October,&#160; November 4th, to be exact.&#160; I’ll repeat the e-mail I got with the details:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Date: November 4th      <br />Time: 5:30pm doors open, 6:00pm event starts       <br />Location: Edmonton Room in the Stanley Milner Library       <br />Event Title: Practical Automated Testing Dojo </p>    <p>As we may have eluded to in recent newsletters, we’re going to try some new style events for this year’s schedule.&#160; In the past the lecture presentations that we’ve held have provided great content in an easily accessible format.&#160; They also seem to have left attendees wanting for more practical and hands on exposure to the technology being discussed.&#160; This event will be the first of those new formats that will allow you to get started with that practical experience while still receiving some guidance. </p>    <p>How the Dojo event will work: </p>    <p>At the start of the meeting (6pm in this case) we will provide a brief introduction talk on Automated Testing.&#160; This will take up no more than 15-30 minutes and is not intended to be an in depth review of the practices involved. </p>    <p>After the introduction a number of volunteers who are well versed in Automated Testing will form breakout teams which attendees will be free to choose from.&#160; Those teams will spend the majority of the remaining event time (1.5hrs plus) working through real world examples of how to write automated tests using different tools and different styles.&#160; While there will be one person who can provide guidance, we are encouraging all attendees to spend time pair programming, watching and engaging in questions with the entire group.&#160; Attendees should also feel free to move from one team to another as the content, styles and experiences may be different. </p>    <p>What, you ask, will the attendee be responsible for?&#160; Well, our hope is that you will feel inclined to bring questions about Automated Testing and a desire to interact and learn with and from the rest of the community.&#160; If you can, please bring your own laptop.&#160; There will be some laptops available but they will be used in pair (or more) programming scenarios only. We will be providing a sample code base that needs many different kinds of tests added to it.&#160; If you want the code at the time of the event, please bring a USB drive.&#160; For those that don’t we will provide the code for download from the Edmug website after the event. </p>    <p>As this is our first event of this style, we are going to treat it as a learning experience and apply those lessons to the coming events.&#160; As always, we encourage you to provide us with any feedback that you can at info@edmug.net </p>    <p>The Edmug Team </p>    <p><a href="http://www.edmug.www">www.edmug.www</a></p> </blockquote>  <p>So, with that out of the way, it’s a pretty loosy-goosy format.&#160; If you are going, is there anything in particular that you would like to see or do?&#160; Some code you would like help with?&#160; Need a laptop?&#160; I will be there, and more than willing to help out with your questions and figured that it can’t hurt to find out in advance some specifics.&#160; Feel free to respond to me either via comments here, or by e-mail (tom at opgenorth dot net).</p>
