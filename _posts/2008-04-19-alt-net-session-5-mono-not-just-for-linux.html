<p>Joe starts polling to see what people want to talk about.&#160; Most seem to be interest the libraries for Mono (being that they also work on Windows/.NET.&#160; So, Joe starts talking about libraries for/from Mono. </p>  <ol>   <li><a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Cecil">Mono.Cecil</a>.&#160; For all your reflecting and assembly modification needs. </li>    <li><a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Mono.Addins">Mono.Addins</a>.&#160; I've been looking at this off and on today, and I have to admit it looks pretty intriguing </li>    <li><a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Rocks">Mono.Rocks</a>:&#160; Handy extension methods. </li>    <li><a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Mono.Zeroconf">Mono.Zeroconf</a>: Zero configuration networking library </li>    <li><a href="http://www.ndesk.org/DBusSharp">DBus#</a>:&#160; A C# implementation of <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus">D-Bus</a>. </li>    <li><a href="http://www.mono-project.com/MonoCurses">MonoCurses</a>: An API for console based applications </li>    <li>GTK# vs Windows:      <ul>       <li>My suggestion is to consider the target environment.&#160; If you targeting Windows, stick with WinForms.&#160; If you're targetting Linux/Mac, go with GTK#.&#160; </li>        <li>Another issue that might influence your decision is that the documentation for GTK# is pretty sketchy, not very good. </li>     </ul>   </li>    <li><a href="http://www.mono-project.com/IOMap">IOMap</a>.&#160; Turning this flag on, will help you with some of the cross-platform development issues.&#160; This is a portable library that will help resolve things like directory seperators, case sensitivity in paths, and that sort of thing. </li> </ol>  <p>A short session, which isn't bad.&#160; Gives me a chance to float around to check out some other things.</p>
