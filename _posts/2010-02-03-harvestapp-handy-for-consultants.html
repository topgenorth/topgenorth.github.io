<p><em><font size="1">Note:&#160; I am in no way, shape, or form affiliated with </font></em><a href="http://www.harvestapp.com"><em><font size="1">HarvestApp.com</font></em></a><em><font size="1">. </font></em></p>  <p>I’ve been an independent consultant in IT for four years now.&#160; One of the biggest things in my day-to-day activities is keeping track of my time.&#160; Timekeeping has become a bit of a thing for me, even when I was an employee.&#160; It probably stems back to about 1996 or so, when my first web application ever was a timesheet application I wrote while working at Alberta Transportation &amp; Utilities (now Alberta Infrastructure).&#160;&#160; It was in C++, using Netscape Commerce Server and CGI.&#160; I even had to write my own libraries to parse the HTTP requests and came up with my own crude templating engine.&#160; Yes I’m old.&#160; Yes, it was interesting.&#160; Yes, we have it better now.&#160; No, I would not like to repeat that experience.</p>  <p>Anyway, over the years, I’ve tried many different things, from a VBA solution based on Outlook, Excel spreadsheets, to <a href="http://www.advancen.com/products/timesheet.html">Timesheet.PHP</a>, to a WebForms app based on the Timesheet.PHP database which I ported over to ASP.NET MVC when I wanted to expand my jQuery and ASP.NET MVC knowledge.&#160; My little home-grown web app was good for what I needed it to do, but it wasn’t anything fancy.&#160; If it was, I’d have sold it and become rich beyond the dreams of avarice.</p>  <p>In the early fall, a friend of mine told me about <a href="http://www.harvestapp.com">HarvestApp</a> – a subscription based, online time-tracking application.&#160; Thought I would give it a try.&#160; My thinking at the time was that I’m not really in the business of writing a timesheet application, and I really need to keep track of time – as a consultant, billable hours are pretty important.&#160; So, here I am now, almost six months later, and I will say that I like HarvestApp.&#160; I find it quick, and easy to use.&#160; I get easy to see reports.&#160; You can create invoices (I don’t use HarvestApp to create my invoices, but you could).&#160; You can track expenses.&#160; It’s mobile friendly.&#160; It’s moderately priced (IMHO – YMMV).&#160; It has a public API so you can write your own applications against it.&#160; </p>  <p>Anyway, don’t take my word on it, try it for yourself.</p>
