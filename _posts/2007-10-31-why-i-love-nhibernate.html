<p>Why I love <a href="http://www.nhibernate.org">NHibernate</a>:</p>  <p>I am rather please by the fact that a database schema change involving the creation of six new tables, three one-to-many relationships, and a many-to-many relationship (which includes a sort order on the join table) can be taken care of inside of seven easy hours.&#160; It probably would/could have been less, but I crafted the HBM and class files by hand and had a few typos which hide themselves well.&#160; This also included the time it took to create some quick integration tests to ensure that CRUD is working.</p>  <p>Now, of course, there are other changes to the domain that need to be done to deal with these new tables, but <a href="http://www.nhibernate.org">NHibernate</a> frees me from paying a significant &quot;database tax&quot;.</p>
