<p>Most who know me are aware that, despite being a .NET developer and a Microsoft MVP, I'm a bit of a Linux freak at heart.&#160; I actually prefer Linux to Windows.&#160; Linux has come a long way in the past 18 years, although I've only been tinkering with it off and on for the past 9 years or so.&#160; I will admit that perhaps Linux on the desktop isn't quite there for the average consumer, but for me it.&#160; And, when it comes to servers, there is no question:&#160;&#160; use Linux unless you've got a pretty compelling reason to run Windows.</p>  <p>I am now about to eat those works.&#160; Or perhaps less dramatically, provide a pretty compelling reason for one to consider Windows over Linux:&#160; setting up and managing a <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> server.</p>  <p>You see, I always used to do this by hand, on a Linux server (typically <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>).&#160; It's not a painful experience, just time consuming.&#160; If you Google, you can even find some VMware appliances that directly target this need.</p>  <p>Tonight I decided that it was time to repave my SVN box at home.&#160; Well, actually I made the decision a while ago, I just only got around to doing something about it tonight.&#160; I figured that I would take <a href="http://www.visualsvn.com/server/">Visual SVN Server</a> for a spin, as I'd heard good things about it from many sources.&#160; I figured that if I didn't like it or it was painful, I had nothing to loose, I'd just fall back on a Linux-based Subversion server.&#160; </p>  <p>I must say, I'm truly impressed.&#160; Inside of about 10 minutes (including download time), I had a SVN server up and running.&#160; It was so drop dead easy, that I'm sold.&#160; Chalk one mark up in the &quot;Windows&quot; column of the operating system holy war debate.</p>
