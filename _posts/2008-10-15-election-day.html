<p>Today is one of those days where they close the bars and all across Canada we get to pick new Members of Parliament (our federal government).&#160; If you're a Canadian reading this, I hope you've done your civic duty and voted.&#160; Democracy is the one form of governance while ensures that people get the government they deserve - so, again, I hope you have or will vote.</p>  <p>On that vein, a couple of statistics I'd really be curious to see tomorrow morning:</p>  <ul>   <li>The number of Canadians that voted in the federal election vs. the number of Canadians that voted for the new Hockey Night in Canada theme song </li>    <li>The number of Canadians that voted in the federal election vs. the number of Canadians that voted in the most recent Canadian Idol. </li> </ul>  <p>On second thought, maybe I don't want to know those statistics. </p>
