<p>My trusty old ADP1 is beginning to show it’s age, and I’m thinking that it’s time to get a new Android based smart phone.&#160; So, what should a guy get?&#160; My criteria (to be modified as thoughts come to mind):</p>  <ul>   <li>Not carrier locked</li>    <li>Would prefer it compatible with the frequencies used by Rogers (I’ve got about 18 months left on my contract with them).</li>    <li>I can install <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/">CyanogenMod</a> on it.&#160; More to the point:&#160; I can install the latest versions of Android as they become available.&#160; <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/">CyanogenMod</a> seems to be the handiest way to do so.</li> </ul>  <p>Personally, I’m thinking either an <a href="http://www.htc.com/www/product/desire/overview.html">HTC Desire</a> or a <a href="http://pages.samsung.com/wireless/product?productid=55">Samsung Galaxy S</a>.</p>  <p>I’m not against a Windows Phone 7 device, but there aren’t any on the market now, and I’m thinking that I don’t want to take the pain of a first generation Windows based device.</p>  <p>If you’ve got any thoughts/suggestions/comments/tips, feel free to post them in the comments.</p>
