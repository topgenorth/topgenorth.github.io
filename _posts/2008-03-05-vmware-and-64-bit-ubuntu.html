<p>Today I got a new hard drive for my web server, to replace the one that died back in February.&#160; Hopefully the new 750GB drive will serve me as well as (or better) the old 200GB WD Cavair.&#160; I must admit, I was a bit suprised at how cheap it was to get such a big HD.</p>  <p>The first order of business was to move my web site off it's current home and onto it's new, more permanent one.&#160; I went about installing Ubunutu 7.10 64 bit, and them VMware server 1.0.4 on the new computer.&#160; If you Google it, are a lot of articles on <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=vmware+server+ubuntu+7.10">installing VMware on Ubunutu</a>.&#160; However, I did run into one stumbling block:&#160; with 64bit Ubunutu you need one more dependency: ia32-libs</p>  <p>If you don't install this, then the VMWare installer can't create an SSL Certificate and your install of VMWare will fail. </p>  <p>So, to recap, on Gutsy Gibbon 64-bit you need to install:</p>  <p>&#160;&#160;&#160; sudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-`uname -r` ia32-libs</p>  <p>From there, follow basically any of the HOWTO's on installing VMWare Server, and all should work for you.</p>
