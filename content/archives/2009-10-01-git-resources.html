At the end of my talk on <a href="http://www.git-scm.org">Git</a> at the Edmonton Code Camp, somebody asked if I would put the links to the various git resources up on my website.  Here they are:
<ul>
	<li>The <a href="http://git-scm.org">git website</a>, of course.</li>
	<li><a href="http://progit.org">Pro GIT</a> - an awesome book about git.  You can either order the dead tree version, or read it online.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8">Linus Torvalds talking about git</a>.  If you're an SVN fan-boy, or have thin skin, you might want to skip this.  "...you are ugly and stupid..."</li>
	<li>A fellow by the name of <a href="http://excess.org/article/2008/07/ogre-git-tutorial/">Bart Trojanowksi gave an awesome talk</a> to some Ottawa ruby group.  This is long, but worth it.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/jason_meridth/default.aspx">Jason Meredith</a>, of Los Techies fame, has a three part series on <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/jason_meridth/archive/2009/06/01/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-1.aspx">git for the Windows Developer</a>.  Jason has some other good git stuff on his blog too.</li>
</ul>
There you go, enjoy, and be distributed.
