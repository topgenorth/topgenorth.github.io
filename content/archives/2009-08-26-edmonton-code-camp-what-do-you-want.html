<p>Well, it’s coming up on fall, which is traditionally the time of year for the <a href="http://www.edmontoncodecamp.com">Edmonton Code Camp</a>.&#160; It seems that there is still a spot or two left for speakers, so if you’re in Edmonton why not think of something programmy and give a talk.&#160; Doesn’t have to be .NET – anything that is related to software development will do.</p>  <p>Anyway, I’ve put my name down for a talk at ECC.&#160; There are several options available for me and I’m not sure which one to go with.&#160; So, I figured that perhaps a straw poll would help me decide.&#160; Feel free to add a comment about which topic you’d prefer:</p>  <ol>   <li>Intro to ASP.NET MVC.&#160; This wouldn’t be my own presentation.&#160; This will be one of the sessions at TechDays in Calgary (this November).&#160; </li>    <li>Introduction to <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>.&#160; Git is an open source, distributed version control system.&#160; I’ve been dabbling with it off and on for the past little while, and am growing rather fond of it. </li>    <li>Introduction to programming on <a href="http://www.android.com/">Android</a>.&#160; Again, another thing I’ve been dabbling in for the past couple of months.&#160; Given that the talks are only about an hour or so, this might be a bit rushed, but could still be of interest. </li> </ol>  <p>Personally, I’m leaning more towards #2 or maybe #3.&#160; What do you think?</p>
