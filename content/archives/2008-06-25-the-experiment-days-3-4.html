title: The Experiment, Days 3 & 4
type: post
---
<p>Just a quick recap of days 3 &amp; 4 of running with openSUSE 11 as my primary OS.&#160; By far and large, not a lot of complaints.&#160; As I do most of my work on a laptop, I tend to keep my VM's on external HDD's connected via USB2.&#160; I've been doing this for a while now, under Windows.</p>  <p>I'm not to sure I'm a big fan of how openSUSE mounts (or tries to mount) my external HDD.&#160; It just doesn't seem as...seamless...as how Windows XP does it.&#160; I'm use to just plugging in my external HDD, and not worrying about it until it's time to disconnect.&#160; openSUSE seems to get a big confused with automounting, and I always seem to have to help it along.&#160; It's something I can live with for now. </p>  <p>The other thing I notice is that openSUSE doesn't seem to want to share the sound card with VMware.&#160; I'm getting more than a few alerts from VMware that the sound card is not available and can't be used.&#160; Again, nothing to critical - for now.</p>  <p>The third thing I'm noticing is that some HDD enclosures seem to work better than others.&#160; I'm noticing that at least one HDD enclosure (a SmartDisk FireLite with a 250GB HDD inside) doesn't seem to want to consistently and reliably work.&#160; I did have VMware (and openSUSE) complain that they could not write that particular HDD as it could no longer be found.</p>  <p>So far, I am pleased with how Linux is handling NTFS as well.&#160; I remember back five or six years ago that NTFS support for Linux was pretty much read-only.&#160; Read-write was for people who were delusionally insane or who go to the same hair stylist as Justice Grey.</p>  <p>A couple of lessons learned:</p>  <ul>   <li>Get lots of disk space.&#160; I'm thinking it may be time to get a 320GB HD for my laptop, and keeping my &quot;working&quot; VM's there.&#160; I'd have something like a 100 GB partition for Windows XP, and then 220GB for openSUSE. </li>    <li>Backups - I'm very happy that I made copies of my VM's and worked off those.&#160; </li>    <li>Fear not the command line.&#160; But if you're a *nix guys, you're probably there already. </li> </ul>
