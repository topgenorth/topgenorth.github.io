title: New Version of YEG Buildings (formerly Historical Buildings)
type: post
---
<p>After a few months of neglect, I put a new version of my Edmonton Historical Buildings application up on the Android Market.&#160; I’ve renamed it to just <a href="http://www.androidzoom.com/android_applications/reference/yeg-buildings_icyx.html">YEG Buildings</a>, as I’d like to eventually include buildings that aren’t historical, but interesting in general for some reason.&#160; The previous version had a nasty bug that would crash when you tried to view the location of a building on the map.&#160; Was one of those curious things where it worked in the emulator but not on a real device.&#160; I’ve tried it out on my HTC Dream running <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/">Cyanogen 6.0 RC3</a> (this is Android 2.2), and it seemed to work.&#160; </p>  <p>I’ve also added a feature where you could see all the Historical Buildings from the <a href="http://data.edmonton.ca">City Of Edmonton’s Data Catalogue</a> at once in Google Maps.&#160; It’s a bit slow (mostly for reasons beyond my control at this point), but it basically works.</p>  <p>You can download it from the Android Market, or via this <a href="http://www.androidzoom.com/android_applications/reference/yeg-buildings_icyx_download.html">handy page</a> at <a href="http://www.androidzoom.com">AndroidZoom</a>.&#160; You’ll need Android 1.6 or higher.</p>
