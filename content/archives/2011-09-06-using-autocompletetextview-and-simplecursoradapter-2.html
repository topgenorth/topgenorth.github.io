title: Using AutoCompleteTextView and SimpleCursorAdapter
type: post
---
<p>I have a simple little pet project (for Android), and one of the things I wanted to do was to to have a text field that would show me previous values as I typed in the text box (see screenshot below). Of course, this control is already a part of the Android SDK - it's our good friend the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/AutoCompleteTextView.html">AutoCompleteTextView</a>. </p><p><img src="http://www.opgenorth.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/AutoCompleteTextView.png" /></p><p>To populate the drop-down, I have an SQLite table called vehicle_descriptions, which looks something like the screenshot below. What I want is for a given vehicle (a value derived from another control on my Activity) to show me the value of the description column in the table.</p><p><img src="http://www.opgenorth.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/vehicle_descriptions_table.png" /></p><p>At first I started out by sub-classing <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/CursorAdapter.html">CursorAdapter</a>, but that just seemed to be a bit to heavy. What I had worked, but it seemed like there should be a simpler way to do this. <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/CursorAdapter.html">CursorAdapter</a> is probably a better choice for more elaborate requirements (maybe displaying images or doing some calculations), but in this case it struck me as overkill - I just wanted to do a simple lookup against a table. Turns out I was right - the easy way is to just use a <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/SimpleCursorAdapter.html">SimpleCursorAdapter</a>.</p><pre>
    &lt;AutoCompleteTextView android:id=&quot;@+id/description&quot;
                          android:completionThreshold=&quot;1&quot;
                          android:layout_height=&quot;wrap_content&quot;
                          android:layout_width=&quot;fill_parent&quot;
                          android:hint=&quot;Trip Description (optional)&quot;
                          android:lines=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;
</pre><p>To setup my control, I have created a function that I call inside onCreate() of my Activity. Here is the code, and then I will explain it in more detail:</p><pre>    
    private void initializeDescription() {
        _descriptionText = (AutoCompleteTextView) findViewById(R.id.description);
        final int[] to = new int[]{android.R.id.text1};
        final String[] from = new String[]{VehicleDescriptionsTable.DESCRIPTION};
        SimpleCursorAdapter adapter = new SimpleCursorAdapter(this,
                android.R.layout.simple_dropdown_item_1line,
                null,
                from,
                to);

        // This will provide the labels for the choices to be displayed in the AutoCompleteTextView
        adapter.setCursorToStringConverter(new SimpleCursorAdapter.CursorToStringConverter() {
            @Override
            public CharSequence convertToString(Cursor cursor) {
                final int colIndex = cursor.getColumnIndexOrThrow(VehicleDescriptionsTable.DESCRIPTION);
                return cursor.getString(colIndex);
            }
        });

        // This will run a query to find the descriptions for a given vehicle.
        adapter.setFilterQueryProvider(new FilterQueryProvider() {
            @Override
            public Cursor runQuery(CharSequence description) {
                String vehicle = getSelectedVehicle();
                Cursor managedCursor = _helper.getDescriptionsFor(vehicle, description.toString());
                Log.d(TAG, "Query has " + managedCursor.getCount() + " rows of description for " + vehicle);
                return managedCursor;
            }
        });

        _descriptionText.setAdapter(adapter);
    }
</pre><p>So, first things first. We setup two arrays. The to[] array holds a list of resource id's that will be used to display the text values in the drop down. I just want to display the items in a list, so I used android.R.id.text1. The other array, from[] hold the name of the column that will hold the values to display. As I mentioned above, I want to show the values in the description column.</p><p>After that we new up a <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/SimpleCursorAdapter.html">SimpleCursorAdapter</a>. The line itself should be pretty obvious. The null that we're passing into the constructor is because we don't yet have a cursor available. In this simple case, the 3rd parameter is android.R.layout.simple_dropdown_item1line will suffice. If we were making our own view for display description, then we'd pass in the resource id of the control that would display the text value.</p><p>After instantiating the adapter, we provide some direction as to how we should convert the cursor to a string value that can be displayed. We do this with a <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/SimpleCursorAdapter.CursorToStringConverter.html">CursorStringConverter</a>. All we do here is retrieve the value of the description column in the cursor as a string and return that.</p><p>The final part is to use a <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/FilterQueryProvider.html">FilterQueryProvider</a> to get a Cursor holding the rows and columns we want to display - note that I'm doing this by actually running a query each time. There are probably more efficient ways to do it (and if you have a better way I'd love to hear it). The line _helper.getDescriptionsFor() will return a cursor holding all the rows from my vehicle_descriptions table for a given vehicle. The user will select the vehicle from my vehicle spinner. I created the method getSelectedVehicle() as a convenience method to return the text that is selected in the spinner.</p><p>And of course, the final thing is to provide the adapter to the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/AutoCompleteTextView.html">AutoCompleteTextView</a>.</p><p>For the sake of completeness, here is what getDescriptionsFor() looks like. The _activity below is a reference to whatever Activity. The code here is should be pretty simple - we just return a managedQuery from the ContentProvider for this application. Note that with our projection we return both the _id column and the description column. The <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/SimpleCursorAdapter.html">SimpleCursorAdapter</a> requires the _id filed be present. Anyway, without further adieu - the code:</p><pre>
    public Cursor getDescriptionsFor(String vehicle, String descriptionFragment) {
        String[] projection = new String[]{VehicleDescriptionsTable._ID, VehicleDescriptionsTable.DESCRIPTION};
        String[] selectionArgs = new String[]{vehicle};

        StringBuffer selection = new StringBuffer(VehicleDescriptionsTable.DESCRIPTION)
                .append(&quot; LIKE '&quot;)
                .append(descriptionFragment)
                .append(&quot;%' AND &quot;)
                .append(VehicleDescriptionsTable.VEHICLE)
                .append(&quot;=?&quot;);
        String sortOrder = VehicleDescriptionsTable.DESCRIPTION;

        return _activity.managedQuery(VehicleDescriptionsTable.VEHICLE_DESCRIPTION_URI,
                projection,
                selection.toString(),
                selectionArgs, sortOrder);
    }
</pre><p>There you have it - <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/AutoCompleteTextView.html">AutoCompleteTextView</a> and <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/SimpleCursorAdapter.html">SimpleCursorAdapter</a> together at last. </p><p> </p>
