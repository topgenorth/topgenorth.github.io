title: 'ALT.NET Session #4: Sprocs Good Or Evil / NHibernate with Cartoon Bears'
type: post
---
<p>Two topics merged into one.&#160; Rod Paddock wants to talk about stored procs, and others want to learn how to explain NHibernate to other people who aren't familiar with it (and minimize the jargon).</p>  <p>Rod uses a custom code-gen solution based heavily on sprocs - a data driven approach.&#160; Sounds like it works well for him.&#160; Oren concurs that this technique could be very effective in certain circumstances.&#160; It will have problems with complex situations that deal with convoluted/difficult data scenarios.&#160; He's giving an example, but I just can't keep up with him.&#160; The point of Oren's story is that a domain driven approach will would better when you're not dealing with data but with data and behavior.</p>  <p>Brad Abrams brings up the point of noun centric vs. verb centric&#160; designs.&#160; Noun centric == data driven.&#160; Verb centric == domain driven.</p>  <p>Oren talks about one of the big advantages of DDD.&#160; We can very easily change the model, as it is all in code.&#160; Tools like R# allow us to make changes quickly, and then NHibernate will allow us to update the database just&#160; as quickly.&#160; Databases are an implementation detail, part of the application, a mere persistence store.&#160; A good domain design will generally lend itself to a&#160; decent database design.</p>  <p>Apparently it is possible to suffer from an SQL injection attack with NHibernate.&#160; According to Oren, you have to be pretty stupid for this to happen, but it can happen.&#160; I did not know this.</p>  <p>Topic changes:&#160; what do you do when you come to a client who has 1.5TB of established data and database.&#160; How do you deal with that?&#160; Ideally, you claim ownership of the data, and carry on.&#160; This isn't very realistic.</p>  <p>Oren starts explaining that NHibernate can allow you to partition the data in existing databases to match your model.&#160; He suggests that it might be better to speak with the DBA to make a new model, as this approach might take a lot of effort.&#160; Might be smarter/better to change the persistence.</p>  <p>Oren's preference is to generate the HBM's by hand.&#160; He wants the pain to be real.&#160; The logic is that the pain will force you to thing about your model, and helps you focus on what is important to your model.&#160; By generating the code, you end up with, for example, a domain model that has 200 classes/tables and classes with 700 fields.</p>  <p>Another advantage of using NHibernate:&#160; you get a nice way to set up a unit of work, and can specify boundaries for your application.&#160; For example, you can, via an HttpModule with your unit of work, limit the number of queries (trips to the database).&#160; Oren:&#160; Going to the database is the best place to optimize, not the query itself.&#160; Minimize the trips to the database.&#160; You can enforce this limit right away.&#160; It is not a problem that will hit you out of the blue in production.</p>  <p>NHibernate is very complex, and the learning curve very steep.&#160; Oren argues it is not overly complex, and this complexity allows you to very advanced things.&#160; For the simple stuff, NHibernate is very easy.&#160; It is very irresponsible to just parachute in, introduce NHibernate, and then disappear.</p>  <p>Oren quotes: </p>  <ul>   <li>&quot;I tend to be nice to people that pay me&quot; </li>    <li>&quot;Use a set, that is all&quot; </li>    <li>&quot;Don't worry about performance until you see you have a hotspot and are using a profiler&quot; </li>    <li>&quot;Whoever designed Linq bordered between genius and madman&quot; </li> </ul>  <p><a href="http://www.flux88.com/">Ben Scheirman</a> refers us to <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/hib_docs/nhibernate/1.2/reference/en/html/collections.html">Chapter 6</a> in NHibernate.&#160; Important for collections.</p>  <p>It seems that this session is not so much stored procs, but a Q&amp;A session from the community about what exactly NHibernate can do.&#160; Oren's knowledge and experience </p>  <p>The CLR is very fast, asserts Oren Eini.&#160; Rod Paddock disagrees.&#160; With WebForms, it isn't the CLR that is slower, it is all the stuff that goes on behind the scenes with the page lifecycle.</p>  <p>The question is asked:&#160; Are datasets more efficient that NHibernate.&#160; Apparently some people get hung up on these types of things, and claim that tools like ORM's aren't good because they add overhead.&#160; Sounds like premature overhead to me.</p>  <p>Unrelated trivia:&#160; This is the latest in the year it has snowed in Seattle since 1968.</p>
