<p>This Saturday past we had the Edmonton Code Camp.&#160; I'd say things went pretty well.&#160; It's my understanding that some 80 people showed up to hear a variety of topics.&#160; I kicked off the day in &quot;Track #2&quot; with a Introduction to Test Driven Development.&#160; For those who are interested in my presentation / code, you can download it <a href="http://www.opgenorth.net/Data/Sites/1/Files/ECC2007_TDDAndUnitTesting.zip">here</a>.</p>
