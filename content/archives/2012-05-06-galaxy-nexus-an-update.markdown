title: Galaxy Nexus - an Update
---

In my last post I flashed a new firmware for the radio on my Galaxy Nexus. I notice that, after a day or so, my problems with connection to Wind Mobile returned. My phone would just not register on Wind's network, regardless of where I was.

Once again I did a bit of search, and read something peculiar (I wish I had booked marked it for reference sake). Some people were claiming that by setting the minimum clock speed of their Galaxy Nexus to 700MHz, that their radio problems had disappeared.

I will say that by setting the minimum clock speed of my Galaxy Nexus to 700MHz I have had zero problems with connecting and staying on Wind Mobile's network (it's been a couple of days now).
