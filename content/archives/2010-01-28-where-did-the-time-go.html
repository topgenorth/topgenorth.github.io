<p><a href="http://www.opgenorth.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/tumbleweed1.jpg"><img title="tumbleweed" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; margin-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="75" alt="tumbleweed" src="http://www.opgenorth.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/tumbleweed_thumb1.jpg" width="90" align="left" border="0" /></a>Yeah, I’ve been kind of quiet as of late.&#160; So quiet, I suspect that some people might be wondering if something happened.&#160; I was a bit surprised to see that the last time I had blogged was after TechDays in Calgary.&#160; Well, nothing significant has happened - just a bit of laziness augmented by a touch of tech-burnout compounded by the odd bit of single malt scotch.</p>  <p>So, now that one month is almost up on 2010, I figured that it was time to start blogging about something again.&#160; The first trick to this, of course, was to figure out what I wanted to do in 2010.&#160; It does seem like there will be a lot of interesting things, technically speaking, coming up this year.</p>  <p>A couple of new things I want to look at over the remaining 11 months:</p>  <p>Mobile development, particularly with a focus on Android<a href="http://www.opgenorth.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/androidrobotlogo1.jpg"><img title="android-robot-logo1" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; margin-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="24" alt="android-robot-logo1" src="http://www.opgenorth.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/androidrobotlogo1_thumb.jpg" width="22" border="0" /></a>.&#160; For the latter half of 2009 I have been dabbling in Android.&#160; I believe that it’s time to go out on a bender, and in a drunken stupor get some embarrassing tattoo and join the Android Army.&#160; So far, I’m at two out of three.&#160; Not bad, huh?</p>  <p><a href="http://www.opgenorth.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/AndroidArmy.jpg"><img title="AndroidArmy" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-left: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-bottom: 0px" height="117" alt="AndroidArmy" src="http://www.opgenorth.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/AndroidArmy_thumb.jpg" width="244" border="0" /></a>&#160;</p>  <p>Ruby is another technology I’d like to explore – particularly Rails.&#160; I can help but think that the opinionated view that Rails development has taken is the way to go for the bulk of web development.&#160; A lot of websites are basically just forms over data, and Rails seems to address that concern rather well.&#160; To bad nobody around here in Edmonton does much Rails development.</p>  <p>.NET 4.0 and ASP.NET MVC2.&#160; I know there is a lot of debate between Web Forms and ASP.NET MVC.&#160; Personally, I think MVC is the better way.&#160; Probably best to keep abreast of what is going on in the ASP.NET MVC world.&#160; And, of course, the DLR in .NET will come to maturity soon.&#160; By maturity I mean widespread acceptance.&#160; If this happens, then maybe developers won’t get so hung up on languages:&#160; i.e. “I’m a C# guy so VB.NET sucks”.</p>  <p>And finally, a guy needs hobbies.&#160; Now granted, my past hobbies of alcohol and <a href="http://www.opgenorth.net/images/tom_AR.jpg">guns</a> (no, not together at the same time) have served me well for the past 20 years or so. However, they are hard hobbies to share with my sons at this point in time.&#160; So, at the start of winter I expanded the geek factor of my sons (and myself) by getting back into <a href="http://www.games-workshop.com">Warhammer</a>.&#160; Now the last time I played was about 20 years ago, with the 3rd edition rules.&#160; In fact, I still have some of the books in my basement from back then.&#160; Anyway, picked up <a href="http://www.games-workshop.com/gws/content/article.jsp?aId=700012a&amp;setLocale=en_CA&amp;amp;_requestid=1241948">The Battle for Skull Pass</a> boxed set.&#160; My son rather likes the <a href="http://www.games-workshop.com/gws/catalog/landingArmy.jsp?catId=cat210008&amp;rootCatGameStyle=">Dwarfs</a>.&#160; I suspect it’s because he’s similar in stature/height to the stunties.&#160; Myself, while I find the <a href="http://www.games-workshop.com/gws/catalog/landingArmy.jsp?catId=cat50030&amp;rootCatGameStyle=">Greenskins</a> amusing, I suspect I might have to move on and get serious with <a href="http://www.games-workshop.com/gws/catalog/landingArmy.jsp?catId=cat40032&amp;rootCatGameStyle=">Dark Elves</a>.</p>  <p>Anyway, enough for tonight.</p>
