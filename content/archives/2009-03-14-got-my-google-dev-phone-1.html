title: Got my Google Dev Phone 1
type: post
---
<p>After an uneventful flight from YEG to PSP, I'm settled in with my family.&#160; After spending some time with beer at the pool, I'm sitting down with my Android Dev Phone 1 that I ordered last week (ship to PSP).</p>  <p>First impressions:&#160; it seems like a nice phone, and I like the fact it has a keyboard.&#160; I don't have a SIM card to help with provisioning the phone, so all I get is this message saying &quot;No SIM in phone&quot; and &quot;Emergency call&quot;.A quick search on Google <a href="http://android-tricks.blogspot.com/2009/01/using-adp1-without-sim-card.html">tells me</a> that how to get around this and use WiFi.&#160; So, that's my task for tonight. </p>  <p>Tomorrow we're heading to the farmer's market at the <a href="http://www.collegeofthedesert.edu/Pages/default.aspx">College of the Desert</a> where I hope to refresh my collection of quality shirts. </p>
