<p>Well, I don't know why it's taken me so long to get to get around to this: but I must say that there are now a couple of &quot;must haves&quot; in my web developer's tool box.&#160; One of them is <a href="http://www.jquery.com">jQuery,</a> and now the other is <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/QUnit">QUnit</a>.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/chad_myers/default.aspx">Chad Myers</a> has a good, quick, <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/chad_myers/archive/2008/08/28/getting-started-with-jquery-qunit-for-client-side-javascript-testing.aspx">post introducing QUnit</a>, I'd <em>strongly suggest</em> checking it out if you do web development (which, IMHO, implies some use of JavaScript, right?).&#160; Chad's post covers the basics pretty good, and I think I would just be duplicating/plagiarizing Chad's work if I were to blog the hour or two I spent getting to know QUnit here.</p>  <p>It is nice to see that JavaScript is slowly being recognized as first class citizen of the web programming world, and is gradually having it's good name cleared of <a href="http://graysmatter.codivation.com/JavascriptRapedMyDogAndOtherFalsehoods.aspx">certain falsehoods</a>.&#160; It's been my belief and observation for a while now that ASP.NET has done a pretty good job of stunting and retarding the adoption/use of JavaScript amongst .NET developers, at least in the Edmonton region.&#160; Good to see that this attitude is starting to change.</p>
