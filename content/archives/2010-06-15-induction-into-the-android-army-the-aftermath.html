title: "Induction Into the Android Army â\x80\x93 the Aftermath"
type: post
---
Thanks to all who attended my “Induction into the Android Army” talk this afternoon at the monthly <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ejug">Edmonton Java User’s Group</a> meeting.&#160; I’d say it was a good turn out, especially when one considers that this is only the second monthly meeting for EJUG.&#160; It was a pretty basic talk, and didn’t dive to deeply into the “fun” Android stuff.&#160; If anybody from EJUG wants a follow up presentation that’s a bit more in depth, give a shout out on the EJUG mailing list.&#160; If there is enough interest, I’d be happy to put something together.  <p>If you want to <a href="http://developer.android.com/resources/samples/NotePad/index.html">browse the code</a> and don’t want to download the Android SDK, you can do so at the Android website.&#160; Otherwise if you have downloaded the SDK,&#160; you can the samples/Notepad folder.&#160; For those who want the PowerPoint slide deck, please hang tight and I’ll get a link to that shortly.&#160; Basil already has a copy of it, and he’ll probably post it to the Google Group shortly as well.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.opgenorth.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/GoogleAndroidarmy.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px" title="Google-Android-army" border="0" alt="Google-Android-army" src="http://www.opgenorth.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/GoogleAndroidarmy_thumb.jpg" width="244" height="152" /></a></p>
