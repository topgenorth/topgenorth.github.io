<p>As mentioned in some of my previous blog entries, I'm looking for am embedded database.&#160; At the present, I think that I will remove SQL Server CE for now.&#160; The biggest reason is that, as part of my pet project, the application to run on <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page">Mono</a> as well.&#160; So, that kind of leaves <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> and <a href="http://www.firebirdsql.org">Firebird</a>.&#160; <br />Now, in theory, it should matter much between the two for what I want to do.&#160; I'm planning to use <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/activerecord/index.html">ActiveRecord</a> for my data layer, and I see that both <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> and <a href="http://www.firebirdsql.org">Firebird</a> are supported.&#160; So, switching between <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> or <a href="http://www.firebirdsql.org">Firebird</a> will be pretty minimal.&#160; What about stored procedures, I hear you say?&#160; Well, truth be told, in my old age, I've sort of drifted away from stored procedures and look at them with a suspicious eye.&#160; So, the fact that <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> doesn't have stored procedures really doesn't bother or impact me at all.    <br />I'll do a bit more comparison between the two, and then decided from there which database to use.</p>
