title: A First Impression of MSBuild
type: post
---
<p>Lately I've been playing with MSBuild, the new build tool that ships with Visual Studio 2005.&#160; Before, I've always used <a href="http://nant.sourceforge.net">Nant</a> for my automated builds.&#160; I've been using nant since 2002 or so, and found it to be a pretty useful, stable tool to take the drudgery out of deploying builds.&#160; Figured I would give MSBuild a try, just for comparison sake.&#160; <br />I must say, MSBuild isn't bad.&#160; One thing that I've found interesting about is that it has been ridiculously easy to port tasks from <a href="http://nant.sourceforge.net">nant</a> and <a href="http://nantcontrib.sourceforge.net">nantcontrib</a> to MSBuild.&#160; So far I've written tasks to apply a label to VSS, and to help me create a zip file holding the deployables of the build. </p>
