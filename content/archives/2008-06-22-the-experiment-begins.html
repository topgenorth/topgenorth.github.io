title: The Experiment Begins
type: post
---
<p>I've decided to try a little experiment, and see how things will go, computing-wise, if I minimize my dependence on Windows.&#160; Now, I don't want to run out and buy a Mac (not yet, anyway), so I'm taking a middle ground.</p>  <p>I first repartitioned my hard drive (thanks <a href="http://gparted.sourceforge.net/">gparted</a>), and set aside a 15GB partition.&#160; On this partition, I installed <a href="http://software.opensuse.org/">OpenSUSE 11</a>.</p>  <p>My plan is to run <a href="http://software.opensuse.org/">OpenSUSE 11</a> as the host OS, and then use <a href="http://www.vmware.com">VMware</a> to run VM's for my work and such.</p>  <p>I'm curious as to how it will work out.&#160; I know the one hurdle I would like to come is the stupid DRM that Apple iTunes uses.&#160; Anybody have some suggestions, so I can do this while it's still legal to format-shift in Canada (or perhaps I should spell it Kanada if bill C-61 passes).</p>
