title: Off to Austin

Well, in a scant few hours I'll be off to Austin, Texas, for <a href="http://www.KaizenConf.com">KaizenConf</a>.  It will be a fun packed couple of day dealing with some very <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/david_laribee/archive/2008/10/27/kaizenconf-workshops-schedule.aspx">interesting topics</a>.  In all honestly, I don't exactly know which of the topics I want to attend - the pretty much all are of interest to me.  Makes me wish I could clone myself.

My plane lands early afternoon, so if you're kicking around Austin and want to entertain an easily amused Canuck, give me a holler (comments here, or on twitter).
