title: Desert Code Camp 2007 Code & PowerPoint
type: post
---
<p>For those who are interested, I put the PowerPoint slides and code from my Intro to Test Driven Development and Unit Test talk at <a href="http://www.desertcodecamp.com/default.aspx">Desert Code Camp 2007</a> <a href="http://www.opgenorth.net/Data/Sites/1/Files/DCC2007_TDDAndUnitTesting.zip">here</a>.</p>  <p>The presentation is in PowerPoint 2007.&#160; If you need me to convert it to another format (PowerPoint 2003, OpenOffice Impress), let me know.</p>
