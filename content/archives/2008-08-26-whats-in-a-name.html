<p>As I was driving home today, I couldn't help notice something.&#160; Microsoft's ASP.NET MVC framework is still in beta, and was only announced last October.&#160; To my knowledge, there are currently three projects in the <a href="http://maps.google.ca/maps?q=Edmonton,+Alberta&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;ll=53.540307,-113.510742&amp;spn=18.606218,57.128906&amp;z=5&amp;iwloc=addr">Edmonton</a> area based off this framework.</p>  <p>Castle Monorail has been around for much longer, three years or so?&#160; It's still listed as a release candidate on it's website, but I'd say Monorail is suitable for production.&#160; Currently, I am not aware of any projects in the Edmonton that are based off this framework.</p>  <p>I guess this is anecdotal evidence that you won't get fired for sticking with Microsoft. :)</p>  <p>The two frameworks have quite a few similarities.&#160; IIRC, in Austin last fall Scott Guthrie did mention that the ASP.NET MVC framework was influenced to some degree by Monorail.</p>  <p>Regardless, it's good news.&#160; Personally, I like both frameworks, and would prefer either of them to Web Forms.&#160; YMMV.</p>
