<p>Well, as predicted something did distract me from my <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/index.php/ActiveRecord">ActiveRecord</a> experiment.&#160; I got a copy of <a href="http://www.genom-e.com">Genome Express</a> while at an <a href="http://www.edmug.net/">EDMUG</a> meeting recently.&#160; Given that my copy of Genome Express was shiny and new, I installed it and began playing.</p>  <p>My initialize impression is that it's promising.&#160; I was able to very quickly reverse engineer a SQL 2005 schema and get a heirarchical data model going.&#160; I was able to generate working DAL code for a 12 table database inside of a couple of hours.&#160; About 75% of this time was spent reading the documentation.</p>  <p>One thing I'm not to sure about is how they pretty much replace SQL. Genome has it's own Object Query Language (OQL) for getting objects from database tables.&#160; Given that I've been working with SQL for the past 12 years, I really don't see why I need to learn a proprietary, non-standard &quot;query language&quot; to find data.&#160; Doubly so with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/data/ref/linq/">LINQ</a> and WinFX floating around.</p>  <p>Another thing that kind of gives me reason to pause is, as a consultant, I don't know how receptive clients would be to me coming in and saying that they have to spend up to $3000.00 to buy another tool.&#160; Especially when things like <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/index.php/ActiveRecord">ActiveRecord</a> do the same job for free, and the source code is available.</p>
