title: 'Fun with Open Source: OpenDental'
type: post

<p>The past week I've been dabbling with an open source program called <a href="http://www.open-dent.com/">Open Dental</a> - mostly trying to see if can get it to compile under Mono, and running under Linux.&#160; I figure that this would be a good opportunity to and work with a cross platform application. </p>  <p>According to their website, Open Dental has been supported under Linux since v4.7.&#160; Here are some notes of my efforts so far.</p>  <p>You will need Mono v1.2.5.&#160; It seems that there is a problem with the Linux binary installer ( a known bug that will be corrected in 1.2.6).&#160; I used the <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Downloads">OpenSUSE 10.2 VMWare image</a> which had a 1.2.5 install all set up.&#160; That solved my problem of getting a current Linux distro with the most recent version of Mono.</p>  <p>There is a website for getting <a href="http://opendental.carlier-online.be/ubuntu.html">Open Dental to run under Ubuntu</a>, and instructions on how to <a href="http://opendental.carlier-online.be/source.html">compile on Linux</a>.&#160; I couldn't get the application to compile under Linux using those instructions.&#160; I suspect that they are a bit out of date.&#160; What I ended up doing was compiling the application in VS2005, setting the build to LinuxRelease.&#160; I then copied the binaries over to my OpenSUSE VM, and ran Open Dental.</p>  <p>Now, Open Dental uses MySQL 5 for a database backend.&#160; The problem that I ran into next is that the database script that is provided to setup the database is for a very old version of Open Dental (like v3.x).&#160; Open Dental is supposed to be smart enough to update the database to the correct version.&#160; However the DB upgrading process seemed to keep crashing.</p>  <p>What I ended up doing was installing the trial version of Open Dental.&#160; This created a database for me.&#160; Once I had a database, the application seemed to run.</p>  <p>A curious thing is that when I would try to run Open Dental on Windows, using Mono 1.2.5.2, the application crashes.&#160; No such problems running under Linux though.</p>
