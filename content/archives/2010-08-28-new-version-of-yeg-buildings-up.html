title: New Version of YEG Buildings up
type: post
---
<p>Last night I pushed a new build of <a href="http://www.androidzoom.com/android_applications/reference/yeg-buildings_icyx.html">YEG Buildings</a> out to the Android Market. The two changes with this one:</p>  <ul>   <li>Rather than showing the latitude/longitude of were you are, the application will try to translate that into a more human-friendly address.&#160; Note that the address might not be 100% accurate.&#160; It depends on how much accuracy the GPS has.</li>    <li>The application no longer uses Google Maps and a KML feed when show where all the historical buildings in Edmonton are.&#160; The map of Edmonton is now rendered locally, and all </li> </ul>  <p>Just for fun, I also <a href="http://contest.apps4edmonton.ca/apps/21">submitted YEG Buildings</a> as part of the <a href="http://contest.apps4edmonton.ca/">Apps4Edmonton contest</a>.&#160; So, feel free to check out the contest page – there are a lot of neat applications there.&#160; Also feel free to vote mine up.&#160; :)</p>  <p>If you are using or have used YEG Buildings, feel free to let me know your thoughts.&#160; If you find a bug, let me know.&#160; If you have a feature you’d like to see, I’d love to hear about it.</p>
