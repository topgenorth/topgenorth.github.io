title: A Sad Day in Whoville
type: post
---
<p>Well, today was a rather sad around the household.&#160; This morning I had to take <a href="http://picasaweb.google.ca/opgenorth/Bailey">Bailey</a>, my dog, to the vet to be put down.&#160; She had just turned 14 years old in September of this year, and age had finally caught up with her.&#160; Her hips were going and we were getting concerned that one day she would be stuck on the floor and wouldn't be able to walk anymore.</p>  <div align="center"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.ca/opgenorth/Bailey"><img style="max-width: 800px" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_ctIzlXft2W0/RaqFYV1PInI/AAAAAAAAAZI/ye5evJ2hDtk/s288/bailey2.jpg" /></a>    <br /></div>  <div class="zemanta-pixie"><img class="zemanta-pixie-img" alt="" src="http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=934c1f73-5e16-8994-b28e-87d64390951f" /></div>
