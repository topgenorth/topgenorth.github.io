title: WIND Mobile and my Nexus One

Just recently I switch my mobile carrier from Rogers to [WIND Mobile](../../www.windmobile.ca "WIND mobile"). Their [Holiday Miracle plan](http://www2.windmobile.ca/en/Pages/unlimitedtalktextdata.aspx "Holiday Miracle Plan") was just to good to pass up - even paying the penalty to break my Rogers contract I will still save money in the long run. Anyway, once the number got transferred over, I didn't have a 3G connection, even after selecting the WIND Home APN.  After a bit of google, it seems that what I had to do is to setup an APN.  In case I can't find it later, here are the APN settings:

|                     |                          |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| APN                 | mms.WINDmobile.ca        |
| Proxy               | \<Not Set\>              |
| Port                | \<Not Set\>              |
| Username            | \<Not Set\>              |
| Password            | \<Not Set\>              |
| Server              | \<Not Set\>              |
| MMSC                | http://mms.WINDmobile.ca |
| MMS proxy           | 74.115.197.70            |
| MMS port            | 8080                     |
| MMC                 | 302                      |
| MNC                 | 490                      |
| Authentication type | \<Not set\>              |
| APN type            | mms                      |

After setting this up, bingo, got my 3G connection going.
