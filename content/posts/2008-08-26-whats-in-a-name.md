As I was driving home today, I couldn't help notice something.  Microsoft's ASP.NET MVC framework is still in beta, and was only announced last October.  To my knowledge, there are currently three projects in the [Edmonton](http://maps.google.ca/maps?q=Edmonton,+Alberta&ie=UTF8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&ll=53.540307,-113.510742&spn=18.606218,57.128906&z=5&iwloc=addr) area based off this framework.

Castle Monorail has been around for much longer, three years or so?  It's still listed as a release candidate on it's website, but I'd say Monorail is suitable for production.  Currently, I am not aware of any projects in the Edmonton that are based off this framework.

I guess this is anecdotal evidence that you won't get fired for sticking with Microsoft. :)

The two frameworks have quite a few similarities.  IIRC, in Austin last fall Scott Guthrie did mention that the ASP.NET MVC framework was influenced to some degree by Monorail.

Regardless, it's good news.  Personally, I like both frameworks, and would prefer either of them to Web Forms.  YMMV.
