title: So, what do you need to do to be considered Agile? 
type: post 
---

One question that has been bouncing around in my mind is what, exactly, does one have to do to be considered Agile?  Let’s look at the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/):

> Individuals and interactions over processes and tools\
> Working software over comprehensive documentation\
> Customer collaboration over contract negotiation\
> Responding to change over following a plan
>
> That is, while there is value in the items on\
> the right, we value the items on the left more.

Sounds pretty simple.  I notice that there are twelve [Agile principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html):

> Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer\
> through early and continuous delivery\
> of valuable software.
>
> Welcome changing requirements, even late in\
> development. Agile processes harness change for\
> the customer's competitive advantage.
>
> Deliver working software frequently, from a\
> couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a\
> preference to the shorter timescale.
>
> Business people and developers must work\
> together daily throughout the project.
>
> Build projects around motivated individuals.\
> Give them the environment and support they need,\
> and trust them to get the job done.
>
> The most efficient and effective method of\
> conveying information to and within a development\
> team is face-to-face conversation.
>
> Working software is the primary measure of progress.
>
> Agile processes promote sustainable development.\
> The sponsors, developers, and users should be able\
> to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
>
> Continuous attention to technical excellence\
> and good design enhances agility.
>
> Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount\
> of work not done--is essential.
>
> The best architectures, requirements, and designs\
> emerge from self-organizing teams.
>
> At regular intervals, the team reflects on how\
> to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts\
> its behaviour accordingly.

The agile principles are interesting, because in a lot of ways I can see advocates of other methodologies (BDUF) saying the believe in the same thing.

Asking amongst some peers, and there didn’t really seem to be a concise definition of Agile and what you need to do to call yourself.  I’ve seen some places that will suggest that they are Agile because they stand up at meetings (or a manager wanders around once a day), avoid documentation, and have a meeting every three or four weeks that they call a “retrospective”.  So, does anybody care to offer up their thoughts on what one needs to do to be considered Agile?  I have my own thoughts, but figured I’d save them for a later blog post.
