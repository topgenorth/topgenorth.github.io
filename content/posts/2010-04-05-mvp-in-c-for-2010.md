title: MVP in C# For 2010 
type: post 
---

I guess I forgot to mention this:  On April 1, 2010, I received an e-mail from Microsoft that my [MVP in C#](https://mvp.support.microsoft.com/profile=31F1E181-79EC-4497-B792-FA8F83D34936) was renewed for the third year.  This makes me a happy, because with Resharper 5 (and therefore Visual Studio 2010) and Windows Mobile 7, I’m hoping that this will be an exciting year for the .NET crowd. 

Well, okay, perhaps I didn’t forget.  Given that it was April 1st when I got the e-mail, I like to give things a few days to settle down.  I am acquainted with some mischievous pranksters who would think it was a funny April Fools joke.
