title: Reloading 8mm Mauser
---
8mm Mauser is a great round, problem is that in North America it's not always easy to find good 8x57mm ammunition. When you do manage to find it, it tends to bit a bit expensive, > $1.00/round. Here is where hand loading pays itself off. I used to handload my own 8x57mm, however I stopped for a few years and now I can't seem to find my old load data.  This isn't a horrible thing as it means I get to go to the range to test out new recipes.

For the first pass, I happened to have a bunch of 150gr bullets. This is a touch light for an 8mm bullet, but it's all I had at the moment.

### Load Data

| Specification | Details |
|---------------|---------|
| **Bullet** | [150gr Sierra Pro Hunter](https://www.sierrabullets.com/store/product.cfm/sn/2400/323-dia-8mm-150-gr-SPT) |
| **Trim Length** | 2.23" |
| **Primer** | Winchester Large Rifle |
| **C.O.A.L.** | 3.04" |

### First Pass Powder Charges

| Load #1 | Load #2 | Load #3 |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **48.5gr** IMR 4064 | **47.6gr** IMR 4064 | **49.0gr** IMR 4064 |


I didn't measure velocities at this time, I just wanted to see how the various loads would group. I'll update this blog post with the pictures of the groups later.
