At the end of my talk on [Git](http://www.git-scm.org) at the Edmonton Code Camp, somebody asked if I would put the links to the various git resources up on my website.  Here they are:

- The [git website](http://git-scm.org), of course.
- [Pro GIT](http://progit.org) - an awesome book about git.  You can either order the dead tree version, or read it online.
- [Linus Torvalds talking about git](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8).  If you're an SVN fan-boy, or have thin skin, you might want to skip this.  "...you are ugly and stupid..."
- A fellow by the name of [Bart Trojanowksi gave an awesome talk](http://excess.org/article/2008/07/ogre-git-tutorial/) to some Ottawa ruby group.  This is long, but worth it.
- [Jason Meredith](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/jason_meridth/default.aspx), of Los Techies fame, has a three part series on [git for the Windows Developer](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/jason_meridth/archive/2009/06/01/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-1.aspx).  Jason has some other good git stuff on his blog too.

There you go, enjoy, and be distributed.
