Life has been a bit busy as of late.  On Sept 4, 2010 a little monster invaded my house.  A savage beast, suitably evolved for our Canadian winters and a fearless hunter of snow-snakes.  Oh, that, and it turns out that she is a distant cousin to my last dog Bailey.  This is my new puppy Casey, who is just shy of 9 weeks old.
