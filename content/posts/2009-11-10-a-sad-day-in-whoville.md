title: A Sad Day in Whoville 
type: post 
---

Well, today was a rather sad around the household.  This morning I had to take [Bailey](http://picasaweb.google.ca/opgenorth/Bailey), my dog, to the vet to be put down.  She had just turned 14 years old in September of this year, and age had finally caught up with her.  Her hips were going and we were getting concerned that one day she would be stuck on the floor and wouldn't be able to walk anymore.
