title: Reloading 8mm Mauser
---

8mm Mauser is a great round, problem is that in North America it's not always easy to find good 8x57mm ammunition. When you do manage to find it, it tends to bit a bit expensive, > $1.00/round. Here is where hand loading pays itself off. I used to handload my own 8x57mm, however I stopped for a few years and now I can't seem to find my old load data.  This isn't a horrible thing as it means I get to go to the range to test out new recipes.

For the first pass, I happened to have a bunch of 150gr bullets. This is a touch light for an 8mm bullet, but it's all I had at the moment.

<table>
  <thead>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Bullet: </td>
      <td><a href="https://www.sierrabullets.com/store/product.cfm/sn/2400/323-dia-8mm-150-gr-SPT">150gr Sierra Pro Hunter</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Trim Length:</td>
      <td>2.23"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Primer:</td>
      <td>Winchester Large Rifle</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>C.O.A.L.:</td>
      <td>3.04"</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

For the first pass, I loaded up three 10 round batches with different powder charges:
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td>Load #1</td><td>Load #2</td><td>Load #3</td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>48.5gr IMR 4064</td>
      <td>47.6gr IMR 4064</td>
      <td>49.0gr IMR 4064</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

I didn't measure velocities at this time, I just wanted to see how the various loads would group. I'll update this blog post with the pictures of the groups later.
