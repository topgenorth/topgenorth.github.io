title: Ballistics of the Norinco 7.62x51
---

After an amateur attempt at trying to calculate the [BC of the Norinco 7.62x39mm](/blog/2017/05/07/norinco-762x39-ballistics/) ammunition, I thought I would do the same thing with Norinco's 7.62x51mm ammo. As one would expect, this stuff is fairly inexpensive as well, running aroun $0.50/round. I don't think this is "precision ammo", but it works well enough in my rifle.

First off, I pulled one bullet apart, and weight it. The projecticle itself weight 146.1 grains, so I guess this is supposed to be 147gr ammo. I measured ~ 42.0 grains of "mystery gun powder".


First some environmental data that I recorded while I was at the range (or looked up on Google Maps) earlier this week:

|   | Imperial  | Metric  | 
|---:|---|---|
| **Altitude:** | 2490 feet | 758 metres |
| **Temperature:** | 47 F  | 8 C |
| **Air Pressure:**  |  27.07899 inHg | 917 mb |

**Humidity:** 77%

Next, after firing 19 (well, it was 20, but only 19 shots were recorded by my chronograph) rounds through my M-305, I collected the following information:


|                       | Imperial | Metric   |
|----------------------:|---------:|---------:|
| **Average Velocity:** | 2670 fps | 814 m/s  |
| **Highest Velocity:** | 2731 fps | 832 m/s  |
| **Lowest Velocity:**  | 2621 fps | 799 m/s  |
| **Extreme Spread:**   | 109 fps  | 33.1 m/s |
| **Std. Dev:**         | 27 fps   | 8.34 m/s |


I'll omit the velocities from the flight of the bullet, we've got enough boring numbers. So running these numbers through the [JBM BC calculator](http://www.jbmballistics.com/cgi-bin/jbmbcv-5.1.cgi) and we get the following two BC values: 


| BC Model | Value |
|---------:|:------|
|G1 | 0.351 |
|G7 | 0.176 |
