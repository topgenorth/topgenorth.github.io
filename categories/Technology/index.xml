      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.samsung.com/global/microsite/gear/gearlive_design.html&#34;&gt;Samsung Gear Live&lt;/a&gt;. One day, all of sudden, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t turn on after I had it charging in it&amp;rsquo;s little charging dock. I thought the problem was with the watch, and Google the symptoms led me to one of two conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The watch was defective, and I should send it back under warranty.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I could fix the problem by taking the watch apart, disconnecting the battery for a minute, and then reconnecting the battery. Or something like that.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was a bit dismayed that for a device not even a year old that these were my options. I was mulling over the options, and I flipped the watch over to see what tools I would need to take the watch apart (who doesn&amp;rsquo;t like disassembling electronics), when I notice that the contact points on the watch were filthy (as one the NCOs on my infantry course used to say when inspecting rifles – &amp;ldquo;crud, corruption, and communism&amp;rdquo;). You can see the contacts for the charging dock right in the picture below:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Wiring Up a Nest</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This weekend I finally broke down and installed a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nest.com&#34;&gt;Nest thermostat&lt;/a&gt; in my house. They have a nice &lt;a href=&#34;https://nest.com/widget/compatibility/&#34;&gt;compatibility wizard&lt;/a&gt; which does a pretty good job of showing you how to wire up your Nest based on the wires you can see in your existing thermostat.  There were two gotchas that their wiring diagram didn&amp;rsquo;t cover. Here is a picture of the old thermostat (a Rodgers-White):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/assets/old_thermostat.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Notice that there were two &lt;code&gt;W&lt;/code&gt; wires. I&amp;rsquo;m not to sure what is up with that, I suspect that that one wire leads up to the humidifier. I ended up splicing the two wires together with a marette, and then connecting the spliced wire to the &lt;code&gt;W&lt;/code&gt; connection on the Nest. This was not documented anywhere on the Nest website.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The other thing that the &lt;code&gt;Rc&lt;/code&gt; post on the thermostat was jumpered over to the &lt;code&gt;Rh&lt;/code&gt; post. All I had to do here is remove the jumper and just plug the wire into the &lt;code&gt;Rh&lt;/code&gt; connection on my Nest. This issue was &lt;a href=&#34;https://nest.com/ca/support/article/How-do-I-install-Nest-if-my-old-thermostat-had-a-short-wire-connecting-Rh-and-Rc&#34;&gt;documented on the Nest website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All in all, the process was quick and easy. Now to see if the Nest actually makes a difference in my energy bill.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>NAS-less in the North</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the Easter long weekend, I experience my own resurrection of sorts.&amp;#160; On Thursday just before Easter I noticed that my NAS, a Thecus N3200 Pro with three Seagate Barracuda 7200.11 drives in a RAID5 array, was beeping and displaying a “RAID degraded” message.&amp;#160; I didn’t worry about it to much, as it was late on Thursday, and I figured I was safe/okay with three drives in a RAID5 array.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Getting Started with My ADP1</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/archives/getting-started-with-my-adp1/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a bit of tinkering, I managed to provision my ADP1 setup without a SIM card.&amp;#160; A bit of google, and here is what I did:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Download the Android SDK.&amp;#160; In my case, I unzipped it to C:\android-sdk-windows-1.1_r1. &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Connection the phone via the USB cable to my computer.&amp;#160; When the phone asks for a device. &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;You&#39;ll get the new hardware dialog, when prompted for the drivers, you&#39;ll need to specify the location.&amp;#160; The Android SDK has the drivers, in my case they were at C:\android-sdk-windows-1.1_r1\usb_driver\x86. &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Once you have the drivers installed cd to c:\android-sdk-windows-1.1_r1\tools. &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Type adb devices.&amp;#160; This should list all the Android devices that you have connected.&amp;#160; If you don&#39;t see any devices listed, then you have a problem. &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Type adb shell.&amp;#160; This will direct your commands to your ADP1 &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Now while at the adb shell, su to root, then :&amp;#160; &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;cd /data/data/com.android/providers.settings/databases/ &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;sqlite3 settings.db &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;INSERT INTO system (name, value) VALUES (&#39;device_provisioned&#39;, 1); &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;.quit &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Reboot the phone &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;adb shell &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;am start -a android.intent.action.MAIN -n com.android.settings/.Settings &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Once all that is done, you should be enable to use your ADP1 as if you had a SIM card in it (we&#39;ll except for the phoning part).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Got my Google Dev Phone 1</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After an uneventful flight from YEG to PSP, I&#39;m settled in with my family.&amp;#160; After spending some time with beer at the pool, I&#39;m sitting down with my Android Dev Phone 1 that I ordered last week (ship to PSP).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;First impressions:&amp;#160; it seems like a nice phone, and I like the fact it has a keyboard.&amp;#160; I don&#39;t have a SIM card to help with provisioning the phone, so all I get is this message saying &amp;quot;No SIM in phone&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Emergency call&amp;quot;.A quick search on Google &lt;a href=&#34;http://android-tricks.blogspot.com/2009/01/using-adp1-without-sim-card.html&#34;&gt;tells me&lt;/a&gt; that how to get around this and use WiFi.&amp;#160; So, that&#39;s my task for tonight. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>VMware and 64-bit Ubuntu</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/archives/vmware-and-64-bit-ubuntu/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I got a new hard drive for my web server, to replace the one that died back in February.&amp;#160; Hopefully the new 750GB drive will serve me as well as (or better) the old 200GB WD Cavair.&amp;#160; I must admit, I was a bit suprised at how cheap it was to get such a big HD.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The first order of business was to move my web site off it&#39;s current home and onto it&#39;s new, more permanent one.&amp;#160; I went about installing Ubunutu 7.10 64 bit, and them VMware server 1.0.4 on the new computer.&amp;#160; If you Google it, are a lot of articles on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.ca/search?q=vmware+server+ubuntu+7.10&#34;&gt;installing VMware on Ubunutu&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160; However, I did run into one stumbling block:&amp;#160; with 64bit Ubunutu you need one more dependency: ia32-libs&lt;/p&gt;</description>
