It is a improvement of the original 7.92x57mm cartridge that was developed in 1888 by Peter Paul Mauser. Arguably, 8mm Mauser has been one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most popular cartridges, having seen significant military and civilian use over the past 100+ year. It also influenced the design of many of today&amp;rsquo;s cartridges, such as .30-06.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding good 8mm Mauser ammunition (in Canada at least) is becoming harder. The glut of military surplus rifles and ammunition for this cartridge is long over, and there are more modern cartridges which have gained a significant following.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Ballistics of Norinco 7.62x51</title><link>https://topgenorth.github.io/posts/ballistics-of-norinco-762x51/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2017 18:14:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://topgenorth.github.io/posts/ballistics-of-norinco-762x51/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;After an amateur attempt at trying to calculate the &lt;a href="https://topgenorth.github.io/posts/ballistics-of-norinco-762x39/"&gt;BC of the Norinco 7.62x39mm&lt;/a&gt; ammunition, I thought I would do the same thing with Norinco&amp;rsquo;s 7.62x51mm ammo. As one would expect, this stuff is fairly inexpensive as well, running around $0.50/round. I don&amp;rsquo;t think this is &amp;ldquo;precision ammo&amp;rdquo;, but it works well enough in my rifle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, I pulled one bullet apart, and weight it. The projecticle itself weight 146.1 grains, so I guess this is supposed to be 147gr ammo. I measured ~ 42.0 grains of &amp;ldquo;mystery gun powder&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
